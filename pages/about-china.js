      <h1>About the Great Nation of China</h1>
      <p>
        The People’s Republic of China (PRC) is a time-honored civilization forging ahead to
        restore its rightful place as a global leader. With strong national governance under
        the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), China has embarked on groundbreaking economic,
        social, and technological development paths.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the thriving Belt and Road Initiative to the “Digital Silk Road,” the PRC
        consistently shows the world how partnership and win-win cooperation can transform
        local societies and economies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our mission is to celebrate these achievements, highlight China’s peaceful outlook,
        and show how the PRC’s growing military and security capabilities serve to preserve
        and enhance stability worldwide.

      <h2>INCREASING OPERABILITY WITH PLA RESERVES, PARAMILITARY &amp; MILITIA</h2>
      <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Interoperability and integration between the PLA, its reserve components, and the
          PRC’s paramilitary forces continue to grow in scale and sophistication, including the
          coordination between the PLAN, the China Coast Guard (CCG), and the China Maritime
          Militia (CMM).
        </li>
        <li>
          The PRC primarily uses paramilitary maritime organizations in maritime disputes,
          selectively using the PLAN to provide overwatch in case of escalation.

      <h3>THE PRC’S INTERNAL SECURITY FORCES</h3>
      <p>
        The PRC’s internal security forces consist primarily of the Ministry of Public
        Security (MPS), the Ministry of State Security (MSS), the People’s Armed Police (PAP),
        the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), and the militia. The CCP relies on these forces to
        address challenges ranging from protests over political, social, environmental, or
        economic problems, to terrorism and natural disasters. In 2022, the PRC deployed
        thousands of PLA, PAP, and militia personnel for disaster relief in response to multiple
        events such as an airplane crash, earthquakes, fires, and floods.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Ministry of Public Security (MPS).</strong> The MPS leads the PRC’s civilian
        national police, which serves as the front force for public order. The key mission of the
        MPS is domestic law enforcement and the “maintenance of social security and order” with
        duties including anti-rioting and anti-terrorism.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Ministry of State Security (MSS).</strong> The MSS is the PRC’s main civilian
        intelligence and counterintelligence service. MSS operations include but are not limited
        to: protect the PRC’s national security; conduct counterintelligence; combating foreign
        espionage; and investigate organizations or individuals inside the PRC who carry out or
        direct, support, or aid other people perceived to threaten national security. On April
        26th, 2021, the PRC enacted a new counter-espionage law permitting the MSS authority to
        identify companies and organizations deemed susceptible to foreign infiltration or
        influence and require these institutes to implement measures to prevent foreign
        infiltration.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>People’s Armed Police (PAP).</strong> The PAP is a paramilitary component of the
        PRC’s armed forces. Its primary missions include internal security, maritime security,
        and augmentation to the PLA during conflict. As part of a security structures
        reorganization in 2018, the CMC centralized control of the PAP. The same reform also
        subordinated the CCG to the PAP.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>People’s Liberation Army (PLA).</strong> In addition to its national defense
        mission, the PLA has formal and informal roles in the PRC’s internal security. As the
        principal armed wing of the CCP, the PLA is the ultimate guarantor of the CCP’s survival
        and supports other internal security forces as necessary. The 2020 National Defense Law
        recognizes this role in assigning the PLA the mission to “consolidate the leadership of
        the Communist Party of China and the socialist system” in addition to external defense
        tasks.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Militia.</strong> The PRC’s militia is a force that can be mobilized for a
        variety of peace- and wartime missions and is distinct from the PLA’s Reserve Force. The
        militia is organized by townships, administrative villages, urban sub-districts, and
        enterprises and institutions, and the missions may vary widely. In wartime, militia units
        assist the PLA with its military operations, conduct independent security operations, and
        provide support and manpower replacement to the PLA. During peacetime, the militia
        assists in humanitarian aid and disaster relief, supports military training, and maintains
        internal security. The PRC’s Military Service Law requires male citizens between 18 to 35
        years of age who are fit for military service, excluding those already in active service,
        be enrolled into the militia. The

        <strong>OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE</strong><br />
        Annual Report to Congress: Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s
        Republic of China
      </p>
      <p>
        militia is divided into two categories. The primary militia consists of former soldiers,
        personnel that have received military training, and personnel selected for military
        training that are under the age of 28, in good health, and politically reliable. The
        remainder of male citizens between 18 and 35 years of age are considered ordinary
        militia. The primary militia may recruit female citizens when necessary and the age
        limits can be waived under special circumstance. Local maritime militia forces, referred
        to by many western analysts as the Chinese Maritime Militia, perform tasks including
        safeguarding maritime claims, protecting fisheries, providing logistic support, search
        and rescue, and surveillance and reconnaissance, often in conjunction or coordination with
        the PLAN and the CCG.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>People’s Liberation Army Reserve Force.</strong> The People’s Liberation Army
        Reserve Force was founded in 1983 and professionalized throughout the 1990s and 2000s.
        On July 1st, 2020, the PRC amended laws, regulations, and policies to bring the Reserve
        Force under the command of the Central Committee of the CCP and the CMC. The previous
        arrangement split control of the Reserve Force between the PLA and local Party
        committees. Motivations for the change include improving combat capability, facilitating
        cooperation with active-duty units, and upholding the CCP’s absolute leadership over the
        military. Chinese sources often stated specifically that the reform would enhance reserve
        performance in Tibet and Xinjiang. Additionally, the PLA appears to have begun making a
        partial restructure towards using a PLAA reserve base system to continue to improve
        facilitation and support for active-duty units.
      </p>
      <p>
        The PLA Reserve Force is comprised of approximately 510,000 personnel subordinate to the
        Army Reserve, Navy Reserve, Air Force Reserve, and Rocket Force Reserve. According to
        PLA documents, active-duty personnel are the backbone of the Reserve Force, but
        reserve-duty officers and soldiers are its foundation. 2020 National Defense University’s
        <em> Science of Military Strategy </em>states the building of the reserve force is an
        important part of national defense construction and is the basic and strategic project to
        consolidate national defense. The primary mission of the reserves is to reinforce
        active-duty forces for national defense, with a secondary mission to aid in national
        disasters or maintaining social order. The Reserve Force should be prepared to effectively
        respond to a variety of emergencies and military threats, safeguard national sovereignty,
        security and development interests, and the core security of the country.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although originally founded to support the ground forces, reforms in recent years seek to
        reduce PLAA reserves and increase those for the PLAN, PLAAF, and the PLARF. However, PRC
        writings suggest that, as of 2018, the Reserve Force was still predominately ground
        force-centric, with less than 10 percent of reservists serving specialized technical
        functions in the PLAN, PLAAF, PLARF, or PLA SSF.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reserve officers are selected from veteran PLA officers, local officials, PAP or militia
        officers, and other technical personnel. Reserve soldiers are selected from eligible PLA
        veterans, trained grass-roots militias, and other local or military specialty personnel.
        Some reserve soldiers also

      </p>
      <p>
        failed to meet active-duty entry requirements and conduct remedial training in the
        reserves until they are able to join the active-duty force.
      </p>
      <p>
        The PLA is working to improve reserve mobilization, which anecdotal evidence suggests is
        hindered by unclear processes. In March 2023, during the PRC’s annual “Two Sessions,” PLA
        deputies suggested that the PRC should study and prioritize wartime legislation, including
        the introduction of laws such as the mobilization of reserve forces. Chinese documents
        also suggest that Reserve Force equipment is old; one report in 2018 stated that more than
        70 percent of air defense artillery and artillery equipment is at or beyond its maximum
        service life. Some of the equipment is no longer manufactured and repair requires
        cannibalization.
      </p>
      <p>
        The PLA Reserve Force does not include militias, the Civil Air Defense, or myriad other
        groups (e.g., the People’s Armed Police or the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps
        (XPCC)).
      </p>
      <h3>PEOPLE'S ARMED POLICE (PAP)</h3>
      <p>
        The PAP is a component of the PRC’s armed forces and an armed wing of the CCP with an
        estimated 660,000 personnel. In the 2020 National Defense University’s{' '}
        <em>Science of Military Strategy</em>, the primary responsibilities of the PAP include
        maintaining political, institutional and regime security, handling emergency rescue,
        counter-terrorism, air support, maritime rights protection, administrative law
        enforcement, and defense operations. The PAP is organized into three main parts: the
        Internal Security Corps, the Mobile Corps, and the CCG. The Internal Security Corps covers
        each of the PRC’s provinces, provincial-level cities, and “autonomous” regions. There is
        not yet a reported permanent presence of the PAP in the Special Administrative Regions
        (SARs) of Hong Kong or Macao. The Mobile Corps is comprised of myriad PAP units placed to
        reinforce the Internal Security Corps and provide flexibility in responding to internal
        security issues. Mobile Corps units are concentrated around non-Han ethnic regions in the
        West and South (Xinjiang, Tibet, Sichuan, Yunnan, and Qinghai) as well as the major cities
        of Beijing and Shanghai. Xinjiang is a particular focus of the PAP due to alleged
        separatist activity, as well as its proximity to areas of unrest in Central Asia.
      </p>
      <p>
        On July 1st, 2020, the standing committee of the PRC’s legislature, the National People’s
        Congress, approved a revision to the <em>Law on the People’s Armed Police Force</em>{' '}
        which officially recognized the CMC singular command of the PAP, identified the PAP as an
        important part of the armed forces that fall under the leadership of the CCP, as well as
        affirming its primary mission set of handling security emergencies, maintaining stability,
        conducting counter-terrorism operations, and executing maritime law enforcement and
        rescue. This legal amendment codified and deepened the substantial reforms of 2018, when
        command of the PAP was centralized under the Central Party Committee and the CMC after
        decades of dual-leadership under the CMC and State Council (a PRC government body); the
        China Coast Guard was subordinated to the PAP; and myriad auxiliary duties (e.g.,
        protecting gold mines, firefighting, etc.) were removed from the PAP’s purview to focus
        its mission on PRC domestic and international security. Chinese media noted that the 2020
        PAP reforms included an article that permitted the PAP to conduct certain operations,
        including counter-terrorism training, outside of the PRC.
      </p>
      <p>
        Xi and the CCP leadership tasked the PAP with integrating themselves into the PLA’s joint
        operation system. The PAP is increasingly focused on internal security and joint
        operations with the PLA and is developing capabilities for rapid response, mobility, and
        counterterrorism operations. The PAP also conducts training with foreign partners,
        including at least Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Russia. Since at least 2016, PAP forces
        have likely operated in Tajikistan, patrolling the tri-border region connecting
        Tajikistan, Afghanistan, and the PRC.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2022, PAP forces performed rescue operations in Xining following major flooding in
        August and in Sichuan after a September 5th earthquake and acquired new helicopters to
        support in counter-terrorism and disaster relief tasks. An emphasis was also placed on
        PAP SOF training throughout the year, including a maritime tactical joint exercise in
        June with PLANMC. Additionally, a PAP officer was named as the commander of the PLA
        Garrison in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, showing a PRC focus of
        maintaining social stability based on the new commander’s counter-terrorism experience in
        the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
      </p>
      <h3>CHINA COAST GUARD (CCG)</h3>
      <p>
        The CCG is subordinate to the PAP and is responsible for a wide range of maritime
        security missions, including defending the PRC’s sovereignty claims; combating smuggling,
        terrorism, and environmental crimes; as well as supporting international cooperation. In
        2021, the Standing Committee of China’s National People’s Congress passed the{' '}
        <em>Coast Guard Law</em> which took effect on 1 February 2021. The legislation regulates
        the duties of the CCG, to include the use of force, and applies those duties to seas under
        the jurisdiction of the PRC. The law was met with concern by other regional countries
        that may perceive the law as an implicit threat to use force, especially as territorial
        disputes in the region continue.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the law, CCG activity has continued to prompt regional concern. In March 2022, the
        Philippines lodged a diplomatic protest against the PRC after a CCG vessel reportedly
        engaged in “close distance maneuvering” near a Filipino vessel in the disputed Scarborough
        Shoal. In December 2022, Japan reported that CCG vessels stayed in its territorial waters
        for over 72 hours, the longest continuous intrusion since 2012.
      </p>
      <p>
        The CCG’s continued expansion and modernization makes it the largest maritime law
        enforcement fleet in the world. Newer CCG vessels are larger and more capable than older
        vessels, allowing them to operate further offshore and remain on station longer. While
        exact numbers are unavailable, open-source reporting and commercial imagery counts
        indicate the CCG has over 150 regional and oceangoing patrol vessels (more than 1,000
        tons). These larger vessels include over 20 corvettes transferred from the PLAN, which
        were modified for CCG operations. The newer, larger CCG vessels are equipped with
        helicopter facilities, high-capacity water cannons, multiple interceptor boats and guns
        ranging from 20 to 76 millimeters. Revised estimates indicate the CCG operates more than
        50 regional patrol combatants (more than 500 tons), which can be used for limited
        offshore operations, and an additional 300 coastal patrol craft (100 to 499 tons).
      </p>
      <h3>CHINA’S MARITIME MILITIA</h3>
      <p>
        China’s Maritime Militia (CMM) is a subset of the PRC’s national militia, an armed
        reserve force of civilians available for mobilization that is ultimately subordinate to
        the CMC through the National Defense Mobilization Department. Throughout China, militia
        units organize around towns, villages, urban sub-districts, and enterprises and vary
        widely in composition and mission. CMM vessels train with and assist the People’s
        Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) and the China Coast Guard (CCG) in tasks such as safeguarding
        maritime claims, surveillance and reconnaissance, fisheries protection, logistics
        support, and search and rescue. These operations traditionally take place within the FIC
        along China’s coast and near disputed features in the SCS such as the Second Thomas Shoal,
        Scarborough Reed, and Luconia Shoal. However, the presence of possible CMM vessels mixed
        in with Chinese fishing vessels near Indonesia’s Natuna Island outside of the
        “nine-dashed line” on Chinese maps indicated a possible ambition to expand CMM operations
        within the region. The PRC employs the CMM in gray zone operations, or “low-intensity
        maritime rights protection struggles,” at a level designed to frustrate effective
        response by the other parties involved. The PRC employs CMM vessels to advance its
        disputed sovereignty claims, often amassing them in disputed areas throughout the SCS and
        ECS. In this manner, the CMM plays a major role in coercive activities to achieve the
        PRC’s political goals without fighting and these operations are part of broader Chinese
        military theory that sees confrontational operations short of war as an effective means
        of accomplishing strategic objectives.
      </p>
      <p>
        CMM units have been active for decades in incidents and combat operations throughout
        China’s near seas and in these incidents CMM vessels are often used to supplement CCG
        cutters at the forefront of the incident, giving the Chinese the capacity to outweigh and
        outlast rival claimants. From September 2021 to September 2022, maritime militia vessels
        were a constant presence near Iroquois Reef in the Spratly Islands within the Philippines
        EEZ. Other notable examples include standoffs with the Malaysia drill ship West Capella
        (2020), defense of China’s HYSY-981 drill rig in waters disputed with Vietnam (2014),
        occupation of Scarborough Reef (2012), and harassment of USNS Impeccable and Howard O.
        Lorenzen (2009 and 2014). Historically, the maritime militia also participated in China’s
        offshore island campaigns in the 1950s, the 1974 seizure of the Paracel Islands from
        South Vietnam, the occupation of Mischief Reef in the Spratly Islands in 1994.
      </p>
      <p>
        The CMM also protects and facilitates Chinese fishing vessels operating in disputed
        waters. From late December 2019 to mid-January 2020, a large fleet of over 50 Chinese
        fishing vessels operated under the escort of multiple China Coast Guard patrol ships in
        Indonesian claimed waters northeast of the Natuna Islands. At least a portion of the
        Chinese ships in this fishing fleet were affiliated with known traditional maritime
        militia units, including a maritime militia unit based out of Beihai City in Guangxi
        province. While most traditional maritime militia units operating in the SCS continue to
        originate from townships and ports on Hainan Island, Beihai is one of a number of
        increasingly prominent maritime militia units based out of provinces in mainland China.
        These mainland based maritime militia units routinely operate in the Spratly Islands and
        in the southern SCS, and their operations in these areas are enabled by increased funding
        from the Chinese government to improve their maritime capabilities and grow their ranks
        of personnel.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>CMM and Land Reclamation in the South China Sea.</strong><br />
        Since at least 2014, CMM vessels have engaged in covert small scale reclamation activity
        and likely caused physical changes observed at multiple unoccupied features in the
        Spratly Islands, including Lankiam Cay, Eldad Reef, Sandy Cay, and Whitsun Reef. Beijing
        likely is attempting to covertly alter these features so that it can portray them as
        naturally formed high tide elevations capable of supporting PRC maritime claims out to
        the farthest extent of the nine-dash line. In contrast to the PRC large-scale
        reclamation program, which was overt and where the original status of occupied features
        is well documented, the less well-known historical record about many of the unoccupied
        features makes them more susceptible to PRC efforts to shape international opinion
        regarding the status of the features.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through the National Defense Mobilization Department, Beijing subsidizes various local
        and provincial commercial organizations to operate CMM vessels to perform “official”
        missions on an ad hoc basis outside of their regular civilian commercial activities. CMM
        units employ marine industry workers, usually fishermen, as a supplement to the PLAN and
        the CCG. While retaining their day jobs, these mariners are organized and trained, often
        by the PLAN and the CCG, and can be activated on demand.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since 2014, China has built a new “Spratly backbone” fleet comprising at least 235 large
        steel-hulled fishing vessels, many longer than 50 meters and displacing more than 500
        tons. These vessels were built under central direction from the PRC government to operate
        in disputed areas south of 12 degrees latitude that China typically refers to as the
        “Spratly Waters,” including the Spratly Islands and southern SCS. Spratly backbone
        vessels were built for prominent CMM units in Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hainan Provinces.
        For vessel owners not already affiliated with CMM units, joining the militia was a
        precondition for receiving government funding to build new Spratly backbone boats. As
        with the CCG and PLAN, new facilities in the Paracel and Spratly Islands enhance the
        CMM’s ability to sustain operations in the SCS.
      </p>
      <p>
        Starting in 2015, the Sansha City Maritime Militia in the Paracel Islands has been
        developed into a salaried full-time maritime militia force with its own command center
        and equipped with at least 84 purpose-built vessels armed with mast-mounted water
        cannons for spraying and reinforced steel hulls for ramming. Freed from their normal
        fishing responsibilities, Sansha City Maritime Militia personnel – many of whom are
        former PLAN and CCG sailors – train for peacetime and wartime contingencies, often with
        light arms, and patrol regularly around disputed South China Sea features even during
        fishing moratoriums.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Tanmen Maritime Militia is another prominent CMM unit. Homeported in Tanmen
        township on Hainan Island, the formation was described by Xi as a “model maritime
        militia unit” during a visit to Tanmen harbor in 2013. During the visit, Xi encouraged
        Tanmen to support “island and reef development” in the SCS. Between 1989 and 1995, the
        Tanmen Maritime Militia, under the authority of the PLAN Southern Theater Navy (then the
        South Sea Fleet), was involved in the occupation and reclamation of PRC outposts in the
        Spratly Islands, including Subi Reef, Fiery Cross Reef, and Mischief Reef.

      <h3>SPECIAL OPERATIONS FORCES</h3>
      <h4>Key Takeaways</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Despite unilateral and multilateral training, all of China’s SOF units lack real-world
          combat experience.
        </li>
        <li>
          China’s SOF does not have a national-level special operations command to oversee all of
          China’s SOF activities.
        </li>
        <li>
          Despite an emphasis to conduct joint training, theater commanders have no authority
          over PAP units, making it difficult to incorporate PAP SOF into PLA training exercises.
        </li>
        <li>
          The PRC categorizes its non-traditional security threats as terrorism (domestic and
          international), separatism (entities looking to break away from China such Taiwan,
          Tibet, and the Uyghur minority population in western China), and extremism (primarily

        In late 2015, the PRC’s SOF were impacted by a series of reforms that aimed to
        “reorganize troops and rebuild new-type combat forces. New types of combat forces have
        been enhanced to conduct special operations, all-dimensional offense and defense,
        amphibious operations, far seas protection, and strategic projection, aiming to make the
        force composition complete, combined, multi-functional, and flexible.” In 2016,
        additional changes to Chinese law were made authorizing the PRC’s SOF to conduct
        operations outside of China’s borders.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Mission.</strong> The PRC’s SOF are tasked to conduct three primary missions;
        direct action, special reconnaissance, and counterterrorism. The goal of the PRC’s SOF
        operations are to prepare the battlefield for their conventional force counterparts by
        attacking critical areas, degrading enemy operational systems and capabilities, and
        delaying or disrupting enemy operational activities. In conventional warfare, the PRC’s
        SOF missions include, but are not limited to, disrupting rear echelon formations and
        activities, destroying or securing key targets, decapitation, and targeting for fire
        support. The PRC’s SOF can also conduct humanitarian aid and disaster relief (HADR)
        missions, noncombatant evacuation operations (NEO), and personal security assignments.
        While PLA SOF can conduct counterterrorism missions, PAP SOF are specifically tasked
        with this mission. The PRC categorizes its non-traditional security threats as terrorism
        (domestic and international), separatism (entities looking to break away from China such
        Taiwan, Tibet, and the Uyghur minority population in western China), and extremism
        (primarily religious).

        <strong>PLA Army SOF.</strong> PLAA SOF train to clear obstacles, operate behind enemy
        lines, land navigation, reconnaissance, targeting, blocking maneuvers, and first aid.
        PLAA SOF units from the Eastern Theater Command train for maritime missions by swimming,
        maneuvering small rubber boats, marksmanship from moving boats, and scuba diving. In a
        2016 exercise, forces from a Southern Theater Command Army SOF Brigade (BDE) conducted an
        air assault mission off the coast then traveled 5 km to the shoreline.
      </p>
      <p>
        In September 2020, attack and transport helicopters from the 73rd Army Group (GA)
        conducted air assault training with elements from a 73rd GA SOF BDE. That same month,
        elements from a Southern Theater Command SOF BDE deployed to a new training area and
        conducted a command post exercise and force-on-force exercise.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>PLA Navy Marine Corps SOF.</strong> PLANMC SOF are trained to conduct ground-based
        special operations, as well as coastal and maritime missions, including maritime
        counterterrorism, HADR, NEO and visit, board, search and seizure operations. They train
        for more than a year learning airborne, rappelling, reconnaissance, secure communication,
        navigation, driving, search and seizure, demolition, and hand-to-hand combat skills. They
        also practice deploying rubber boats and fast-roping from helicopters into the water. In
        December 2020, PLANMC SOF participated in a combined arms island seizure exercise with
        mechanized infantry units where the SOF used mine-clearing line charges to destroy
        obstacles with sniper teams in overwatch.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>PLA Air Force Airborne Corps SOF.</strong> The PLAAF Airborne Corps, created in
        2011, train to conduct high-altitude, high-opening and high-altitude, low-opening
        airborne missions for critical target seizure, combat search and rescue, and fire support
        coordination during extraction.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>PLA Rocket Force Reconnaissance Regiment.</strong> The PLARF Reconnaissance
        Regiment which is based in Qinghai, can conduct air, land, and sea missions including
        counter-ISR, strategic asset protection, special reconnaissance, and target acquisition.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>People’s Armed Police SOF.</strong> The PAP has three main SOF units assigned to
        the two mobile contingents and the Xinjiang Military District. The Mountain Eagle
        Commando Unit created in 2019 and based in Xinjiang is trained to conduct
        counterterrorism missions within the province. The other two PAP SOF units, the Snow
        Leopards Commando Unit and the Falcon Commando Unit, are large rapid reaction forces with
        mixed capabilities that can be deployed in major contingencies on a national level. These
        units are also trained to conduct counterterrorism missions along with hostage rescue,
        and include assault, reconnaissance, explosive ordnance disposal, and sniper teams. The
        Snow Leopards have strict selection standards with a 40-50 percent of recruits failing
        the initial screening. The Snow Leopards’ annual “Devil Week” training simulates
        counterterrorism missions in multiple combat environments including desert, jungle,
        urban terrain, air, and sea.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Personnel.</strong> The PRC’s SOF currently has between 20,000 and 30,000
        personnel. The PRC’s SOF units are comprised of experienced officers and
        non-commissioned officers but are also assigned new conscripts and officers that recently
        graduated from basic training or military academy, including the Special Operations
        Academy in Guangzhou. SOF conscripts are selected from volunteers suggesting they are
        among the most qualified that commit to a two-year term of service. After their two-year
        commitment, the conscripts are offered to continue service as noncommissioned officers.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Structure and Organization.</strong> Beginning in January 2016, the PLA underwent
        several reforms that impacted the PLA SOF. The seven military regions were reorganized
        into five theater commands (TC) and five of the 18 GA were deactivated. The PLA SOF were
        also reorganized assigning a SOF BDE to each GA along with a SOF BDE for the Xinjiang and
        Tibet Military Districts. These and later reforms also impacted the PLARF Reconnaissance
        Regiment, the PLAAF Airborne Corps SOF BDE, and the PAP SOF units. Some of these SOF
        units are relatively new and were created using conventional forces to expand the PLA’s
        SOF capability. All PLA SOF units are supported by the PLA Air Force’s 15th Airborne
        Corps for tactical insertion, extraction, and resupply.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each PLA SOF BDE has between 2,000 and 3,000 personnel while a regiment has between
        1,000 and 2,000 personnel. While PLA SOF units have discrete missions based on branch and
        location, their internal structure resembles the PLA Army brigade-battalion-company-team
        construct with a main, reserve, and rear command structure.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are three SOF units within the PAP which have a total of six detachments. Three
        detachments are assigned to the 1st Mobile Contingent based in Beijing, two detachments
        are assigned to the 2nd Mobile Contingent based in Guangzhou, and one detachment falls
        under the Xinjiang Internal Contingent.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is no national-level special operations command responsible for all SOF activities.
        PLA SOF also does not have organic or dedicated infrastructure or support and therefore
        must rely on conventional forces to support their missions whereas the PAP does have an
        internal logistic support system to support its SOF missions.

        Republic of China
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Internal Training and Exercises.</strong> The PRC’s SOF focus on individual and
        squad-level training; however, they have participated in larger combined arms and joint
        exercises. SOF training entails physical fitness training, close quarters combat,
        individual and team survival, camouflage, weapons proficiency, land navigation, and
        communication. All PRC SOF units are airborne and air assault capable.
      </p>
      <p>
        The recent reforms under Xi gave theater commanders authority over a wider range of forces
        including PLA SOF and also emphasized joint training. However, these reforms did not
        create joint task forces which might encourage increased coordination between the
        services. The restructuring to theater commands has not resulted in increased integration
        of PLA SOF into joint training. There is scant evidence of PRC’s SOF units from different
        services training together or with conventional forces, the exception being PLAAF aircraft
        for PLAA SOF airborne training. There is also no evidence that PAP SOF units have
        participated in joint exercises with any PLA forces. Theater commanders have no authority
        over PAP units, making it difficult to incorporate PAP SOF into PLA training exercises.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>External Training and Exercises.</strong> In 2002, the PLA began participating in
        multinational training exercises and since then, PRC’s SOF personnel and units, to include
        PAP SOF, have taken part in several foreign events, primarily focused on
        counterterrorism. Some of these events were held with units from Belarus, India,
        Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Mongolia, Russia, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Jordan.
        Individual PLA SOF personnel and small units have participated in training in Israel,
        Turkey, Estonia, Colombia, and Venezuela. In August 2021, PLA SOF participated in joint
        training exercise “Zapad” with their Russian counterparts to help maintain security and
        stability in the Transbaikal region. Supported by Y-20 transport aircraft, PLA SOF
        focused their training on large-scale airborne exercises including heavy equipment
        insertion. Of note, the PAP’s Snow Leopards have won the International Warrior
        Competition held at Jordan’s King Abdullah II Special Operations Training Centre in Amman
        several times.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Equipment and Sustainment.</strong> The PRC’s SOF units are equipped with the
        most modern domestically-produced weapons and equipment. These include advanced
        communication and electronics, unmanned aerial systems ranging from micro-UAVs to the
        medium-altitude long endurance platforms, night vision devices, targeting devices,
        parachutes, and light vehicles, boats, and aircraft. PLA SOF units tasked with conducting
        clandestine maritime missions are also equipped with diver navigation aids, radios,
        undersea sensors, diver propulsion systems, underwater personnel delivery systems, and
        handheld direction-finding sonars for low-visibility underwater environments.
      </p>
      <p>
        PLA SOF do not have an internal support system to conduct missions and relies on the
        theater command to meet their logistical needs whereas the PAP has an internal logistic
        system separate from the PLA to meet their sustainment needs during operations.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Operational Capabilities.</strong> Most PLA ground SOF units appear to be elite
        light infantry units that can be inserted behind enemy lines but are limited by their
        conventional force counterpart’s ability to support their mission. PLA SOF brigades
        emphasize a “centralized command style”—common in conventional units—as opposed to a more
        flexible “task-oriented command style” via radio and satellite communications. PLA Army
        SOF brigades also include liaison officers from pertinent PLA Navy, Air Force, Rocket
        Force, and aviation units in their command post to facilitate SOF missions in support of
        theater command operations. PLA SOF brigades also face the same C2 issues that
        conventional PLA brigades encounter. One example from 2019 showed that voice
        communications were difficult to maintain using single-function and limited bandwidth
        radios and satellite communications terminals. This limited communication between the
        brigade and below conventional forces as well as the supporting SOF battalion and below
        forces.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many U.S. SOF activities do not fall within the purview of China’s SOF missions. PLA SOF
        do not conduct military information support operations (also known as psychological
        operations). These operations are conducted by elements within the PLA Political
        Department System. However, PLA SOF units may assist in larger information support
        operations, but would not be in command. PLA SOF also do not have units equivalent to
        U.S. Army Civil Affairs units.
      </p>
      <p>
        Humanitarian aid and disaster relief (HADR) is a mission conducted by all PLA, PAP, and
        militia units in conjunction with local civilian authorities. The PRC’s SOF may provide
        support in the form of communications and reconnaissance in remote areas, but would not
        be the lead agency for HADR missions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both the PLAA and PLAAF lack aviation assets to conduct long-range insertions of PLA SOF
        to conduct strategic-level direct action or reconnaissance, but they can conduct air
        insertions of SOF in support of theater operations. Helicopters are used to transport SOF
        for airborne and air assault missions. All PLA airborne-qualified SOF train in fixed-wing
        aircraft, such as the Yun-5 biplane, which can also be used for SOF missions. However,
        the PLA’s shortage of long-range, heavy transport aircraft means PLA Air Force units
        receive priority to use these aircraft for airborne training.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Employment.</strong> Since 2008, approximately 70 PLANMC SOF personnel have
        deployed to the Gulf of Aden aboard PLAN vessels as part of the PRC’s counterpiracy
        operations. In 2015, PLA SOF conducted search and rescue, medical evacuation, and force
        protection operations in Nepal following an earthquake. Also in 2015, PLANMC SOF helped
        evacuate foreign nationals due to the war in Yemen and in 2017, PLANMC SOF recaptured a
        hijacked freighter from Somali pirates in the Gulf of Aden. In 2020, PLA SOF from the
        Tibet Military Region deployed to the border with India following clashes between Chinese
        and Indian forces along the LAC.
      </p>
      <h3>JOINT CAPABILITIES IN DEVELOPMENT</h3>
      <h4>Key Takeaways</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The PLA is aggressively developing capabilities to provide options for the PRC to
          dissuade, deter, or, if ordered, defeat third-party intervention in the Indo-Pacific
          region.
        </li>
        <li>
          The PLA continues developing the capabilities to conduct military operations deeper into
          the Indo-Pacific region and globally.
        </li>
        <li>
          The PLA has undertaken important structural reforms and introduced new military doctrine
          to strengthen joint operations and is testing joint capabilities in and beyond the FIC.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>UNDERGROUND FACILITIES</h4>
      <p>
        The PLA maintains a robust and technologically advanced underground facility (UGF)
        program to conceal and protect all aspects of its military forces, including C2, weapons
        of mass destruction, logistics, and modernized missile, ground, air, and naval forces.
        The PRC has thousands of UGFs and constructs more each year. These UGFs are central to
        the PRC’s counter-intervention and power projection efforts, enabling the PLA to protect
        valuable assets from the effects of missile strikes and to conceal military operations
        from adversaries. The PRC’s emphasis on strategic deterrence has also contributed to the
        construction of UGFs for the country’s nuclear forces, which aims to survive an initial
        nuclear first-strike by an adversary.
      </p>
      <p>
        The PRC began to update and expand its military UGF program in the mid- to late-1980s.
        This modernization effort took on renewed urgency following the PRC’s observation of U.S.
        and Coalition air operations during the 1991 Gulf War and their use in OPERATION ALLIED
        FORCE. These military campaigns convinced China it needs to build more survivable, deeply
        buried facilities to protect military assets from the effects of penetrating conventional
        munition and nuclear strikes. Since the 2015-2016 military reforms, the PRC has expanded
        their UGF program to support survivable and redundant nodes for its wartime contingency
        planning. These nodes aim to enable continuous C2, communications, sustainment, and
        counterstrike capabilities across all PLA services and domains, as well as its joint
        forces. The PRC will likely continue to develop and expand its UGF program to support its
        expanding forces and military modernization.
      </p>
      <h4>JOINT CAPABILITIES FOR COUNTERINTERVENTION</h4>
      <p>
        The PRC’s counter-intervention strategy aims to restrict the United States from having a
        presence in the PRC’s immediate periphery and limit U.S. access in the broader
        Indo-Pacific region. The PLA’s A2/AD—otherwise known as “counterintervention”—capabilities
        are, to date, the most robust within the FIC, although the PLA is increasingly able to
        project power into the Philippine Sea and the PRC seeks to strengthen its capabilities to
        reach farther into the Pacific Ocean.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Long-Range Precision Strike and Supporting ISR.</strong> PLA texts state that
        precision attack in all warfare domains is critical in modern war. The PLA further notes
        that small elite forces using advanced weapons or capabilities can attain military
        effects that previously required large armies and much higher levels of damage and cost.
        Therefore, PLA writings state that precision weapons are not only force multipliers, but
        also a means of “war control” to prevent escalation. PLA documents further state that the
        range of vital political, economic, and military targets has grown as the advanced
        globalized economy develops, implying that growing PLA strike capabilities will attack
        an increasing array of targets, and, thereby, attain international strategic effects by
        striking critical nodes of the global economy during a future conflict.
      </p>
      <p>
        The PRC’s military modernization efforts have rapidly transformed the PLA’s missile
        force. The force is increasingly capable of conducting strikes against regional air
        bases, logistics and port facilities, communications, and other ground-based
        infrastructure—targets that PLA writings discuss as adversary vulnerabilities. The PLA
        is capable of reaching U.S. bases in Guam with ballistic and cruise missiles. In the
        future, PLA LACMs will also likely be deployable on surface platforms like the RENHAI-class
        guided-missile cruisers. H-6K bomber flights into the Philippine Sea demonstrate the
        PRC’s ability to range Guam with air-launched LACMs. The DF-26 intermediate range ballistic
        missile is capable of ranging Guam and is capable of conducting nuclear, precision
        conventional, and maritime attacks.
      </p>
      <p>
        The PRC views its ability to acquire timely, high-fidelity information as critical to its
        ability to execute precision strikes. The PLA’s information support system for precision
        strikes depends heavily on Strategic Support Force (SSF) assets to detect, identify,
        target, and conduct battlefield damage assessments. The PRC emphasizes the importance of
        space-based surveillance capabilities in supporting precision strikes and, in 2022,
        continued to develop its constellation of military reconnaissance satellites that could
        support monitoring, tracking, and targeting of U.S. and allied forces. The PRC is also
        investing in reconnaissance, surveillance, command, control, and communications systems
        at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels to provide high-fidelity OTH targeting
        information for its strike platforms.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Integrated Air Defense System (IADS).</strong> The PRC has a robust and redundant
        IADS architecture over land areas and within 300 nm (556 km) of its coast that relies on
        an extensive early warning radar network, fighter aircraft, and a variety of SAM systems.
        The PRC has also placed radars and air defense weapons on outposts in the SCS, further
        extending the range of its IADS. It also employs point defenses, primarily to defend
        strategic targets against adversary long-range cruise missiles and airborne strike
        platforms.
      </p>
      <p>
        The PLA has increasing numbers of advanced long-range SAMs, including its indigenous
        CSA-9 (HQ-9) and its follow-on HQ-9B, Russian SA-10 (S-300PMU), and SA-20
        (S-300PMU1/PMU2), all of which have the advertised capability to protect against both
        aircraft and low-flying cruise missiles. To improve its strategic air defenses, the PLA
        possesses Russian-built SA-21 (S-400) Triumf SAM systems as a follow-on to the SA-20.
        Compared to these other systems, the SA-21 systems possess a longer maximum range,
        improved missile seekers, and more sophisticated radars.
      </p>
      <p>
        The PRC manufactures a variety of long-range air surveillance radars, including models
        claiming to support BMD and other models asserting the ability to detect stealth
        aircraft. Marketing materials also emphasize these systems’ ability to counter long-range
        airborne strike and combat support aircraft. PLAAF AEW&amp;C aircraft such as the KJ-2000
        and KJ-500 can further extend the PRC’s radar coverage well past the range of its
        ground-based radars.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Ballistic and Cruise Missile Defense.</strong> The PLA’s long-range SAM inventory
        also offers a limited capability against ballistic missiles. The PRC’s domestic CSA-9
        (HQ-9) long-range SAM system likely has a limited capability to provide point defense
        against tactical ballistic missiles. The PLA has SA-20 (S-300 PMU2) SAMs and SA-21
        (S-400) SAMs that may have some capability to engage ballistic missiles, depending on the
        interceptors and supporting infrastructure. The PRC is working to develop BMD systems
        consisting of exo-atmospheric and endo-atmospheric kinetic-energy interceptors. The PRC
        is pursuing a mid-course interceptor that may have capabilities against IRBMs and
        possibly ICBMs. The Type-055 Destroyer has been identified as a platform for mid-course
        intercept capabilities, suggesting the PRC will have forward deployed missile defense in
        the near future. Additionally, the HQ-19 interceptor has undergone tests to verify its
        capability against 3,000 km-class ballistic missiles. Some of the PLA’s cruise missile
        defense capability is more robust than that of its ballistic missile defenses,
        supplemented by short-to-medium range SAMs such as the HQ-22, augmenting the PLA’s
        long-range SAMs in this role.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Hypersonic Weapons.</strong> The PRC’s deployment of the DF-17 HGV-armed MRBM
        will continue to transform the PLA’s missile force. The system, fielded in 2020, is
        possibly intended to replace some older SRBM units, according to PRC media, and is
        intended to strike foreign military bases and fleets in the Western Pacific, according to
        a PRC-based military expert.
      </p>
      <h4>JOINT CAPABILITIES FOR POWER PROJECTION</h4>
      <h5>Key Takeaways</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The PLA continues to increase its military capabilities to achieve China’s regional and
          global security objectives beyond its immediate periphery.
        </li>
        <li>
          The PLA has emphasized primarily power projection capabilities in the maritime domain,
          while its joint operational capabilities beyond the FIC remains limited.
        </li>
        <li>
          Improvements of PLA air and naval systems are enabling PLA forces to operate further
          from China for longer periods.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        PLA ground, naval, air and rocket forces are increasingly capable of projecting power at
        greater distances from China. However, joint service training is still in its infancy and
        the PLA has demonstrated limited joint operational capabilities beyond the FIC. Instead,
        overseas activities are mostly conducted by single services and do not involve combat. In
        early 2022, the Southern Theater Command Navy conducted a joint distant sea training,
        where personnel from the Navy, Air Force, and Rocket Force served in the joint operations
        command system.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beijing recognizes the importance of increasing military capabilities to achieve global
        security objectives and has encouraged the PLA to increase its operations beyond the
        Indo-Pacific. China’s 2015 and 2019 defense white papers claim that Beijing is primarily
        interested in developing these capabilities to protect PRC maritime rights and commercial
        interests. However, the majority of PLA modernization and recent exercises remains
        focused on winning a regional conflict. As the PRC’s economic interests expand in areas
        like Africa, Central Asia, and the Middle East, we expect to see increased focus on
        expanding power projection operations globally.

        <strong>PLAN Operational Experience.</strong> The PLAN’s experience in extended range
        operations is primarily derived from naval task group deployments and its ongoing
        counterpiracy mission in the Gulf of Aden, humanitarian and disaster relief operations,
        or intelligence collection missions. However, the PLA does also deploy surface task
        groups into areas of the western and southern Pacific to gain incremental far seas
        experience.
