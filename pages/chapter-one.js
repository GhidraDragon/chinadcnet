      <h2>STRATEGIC SUPPORT FORCE (SSF)</h2>
      <p><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The SSF is a theater command-level organization established to centralize the PLA’s
          strategic space, cyberspace, electronic, information, communications, and
          psychological warfare missions and capabilities.
        </li>
        <li>
          The SSF’s Network Systems Department (NSD), sometimes referred to as the Cyberspace
          Force (CSF; 网络空间部队) is responsible for information warfare with an integrated
          mission set that includes cyberspace warfare, technical reconnaissance, electronic
          warfare, and psychological warfare. The PLA SSF’s Space Systems Department (SSD),
          sometimes referred to as the Aerospace Force (ASF; 航天部队), is responsible for
          military space operations.
        </li>
        <li>
          The PRC continues to develop counterspace capabilities—including direct-ascent
          anti-satellite missiles, co-orbital satellites, electronic warfare, and directed-energy
          systems—that can contest or deny an adversary’s access to and operations in the space
          domain during a crisis or conflict.
        </li>
        <li>
          The PRC’s space enterprise continues to mature rapidly and Beijing has devoted
          significant resources to growing all aspects of its space program, from military space
          applications to civil applications such as profit-generating launches, scientific
          endeavors, and space exploration. SSF works with civilian organizations, such as
          universities and research organization, to integrate civilian support to military
          efforts.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The SSF was established in 2015 to centralize the PLA’s strategic space, cyberspace,
        electronic, and psychological warfare missions and capabilities. The SSF reports directly
        to the CMC and supports the entire PLA with its capabilities. The PRC’s 2019 defense
        white paper described the SSF’s modernization goals as “seeking to achieve big
        development strides in key areas and accelerate the integrated development of new-type
        combat forces, so as to build a strong and modernized strategic support force.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The SSF oversees two deputy theater command-level departments: the SSD, sometimes
        referred to as the ASF, is responsible for military space operations, and the NSD,
        sometimes referred to as the CSF, responsible for information operations (IO), which
        includes technical reconnaissance, EW, cyberspace warfare, and psychological
        operations. At the headquarters level, the SSF has a four-department administrative
        structure that includes the Staff, Equipment, Political Work, and Logistics Departments.
        As a strategic organization, the SSF is directly subordinate to the CMC, but some of its
        subordinate units may report to the theater commands in wartime. The SSF provides
        information support derived from space-, cyber-, and terrestrial-based means to all PLA
        services and the five joint theater commands. Civilian reserve and militia units – typically
        comprised of personnel from the Ministry of Information and Industry Technology,
        Ministry of Public Security, Ministry of State Security, and academic institutions – augment
        SSF cyberspace operations during peacetime and are organized into specialized units
        during wartime to support network defense operations.
      </p>
      <p>
        General Ju Qiansheng has served as SSF commander since 2021. He previously served as
        commander of the NSD. Lt. Gen. Shang Hong recently served as commander of the SSD,
        until leaving that position sometime in 2023, but a replacement has not been identified.
        The leader of the NSD is unknown.
      </p>
      <p>
        Network Systems Department. The SSF NSD, also referred to as the CSF, is responsible
        for information warfare with a mission set that includes cyberspace warfare, technical
        reconnaissance, EW, and psychological warfare. By placing the SSF NSD missions under
        the same organizational umbrella, the PRC seeks to remedy the operational coordination
        challenges that hindered information sharing under the PLA’s pre-reform organizational
        structure. The incorporation of cyberspace and EW elements under one organization was a
        crucial step towards realizing the operational concept of integrated network and electronic
        warfare that the PLA has envisioned since the early 2000s. The NSD operates five
        theater–aligned technical reconnaissance bases, a number of signals intelligence bureaus,
        and several research institutes. The NSD provides intelligence support to the theater
        commands by leveraging a diverse suite of ground-based technical collection assets to
        provide a common operating picture to geographically dispersed operational units.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          The SSF and the “Three Warfares” Concept: The SSF NSD, or CSF, performs missions
          and tasks associated with the PLA’s concept of “Three Warfares,” which comprises
          psychological warfare, public opinion warfare, and legal warfare. This department is
          the only publicly known organization in the PLA that performs psychological warfare
          operations. See 2022 CMPR “Special Topic: PRC Views of Information and Information
          Dominance” for more on PLA views on information warfare, including psychological
          warfare.
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        SSF SPACE SYSTEMS DEPARTMENT
      </p>
      <p>
        The SSD, sometimes referred to as the ASF, is responsible for nearly all PLA space
        operations, including space launch and support; space surveillance; space information
        support; space telemetry, tracking, and control; and space warfare. The PRC seeks to
        enhance the PLA’s command and control C2 for joint operations and establish a real-time
        surveillance, reconnaissance, and warning system, and it is increasing the number and
        capabilities of its space systems, including communications and intelligence satellites, as
        well as the BeiDou navigation satellite system.
      </p>
      <p>
        The SSD operates at least eight bases, including those whose core missions are the
        launch, tracking, R&amp;D, and operation of the satellites vital to the PRC’s overhead
        C4ISR architecture. The SSD operates tracking, telemetry, and command (TT&amp;C)
        stations in multiple locations worldwide to guide space missions around the Earth as well
        as in cislunar and deep space. The SSD also operates Yuanwang space support ships that
        track satellite and ICBM launches.
      </p>
      <p>
        China has five launch sites, including four land-based and one sea-based. The SSD’s
        China Launch and Tracking Control (CLTC) operates all four fixed launch sites in China,
        in addition to Yuanwang space support ships (SESS), two major satellite control centers—
        Xian Satellite Control Center (XSCC) and the Beijing Aerospace Control Center (BACC)—
        and the PLA TT&amp;C system for all Chinese satellites.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other Space and Counterspace Organizations. The PRC’s space program comprises
        organizations in the military, civil, defense-industrial, and commercial sectors. The PLA
        historically has managed the PRC’s space program and continues to support both civilian
        and military interests. This includes strengthening and investing in its science and
        technology sector, growing international partnerships, and improving the PRC’s
        capabilities in space-based ISR, SATCOM, satellite navigation, human spaceflight, and
        robotic space exploration. Although state-owned enterprises are China’s primary space
        contractors, the PRC is placing greater emphasis on decentralizing and diversifying its
        space industry to increase competition.
      </p>
      <p>
        The State Council’s State Administration for Science, Technology, and Industry for
        National Defense (SASTIND) is the primary civilian organization that coordinates and
        manages the PRC’s space activities, including allocating space research and development
        funds. It also maintains a working relationship with the PLA organization that oversees
        the PRC’s military acquisitions. SASTIND guides and establishes policies for state-owned
        entities conducting the PRC’s space activities.
      </p>
      <p>
        The China National Space Administration (CNSA), subordinate to SASTIND, conducts
        China’s civilian space efforts, including human spaceflight at the Chinese space station,
        lunar missions, and interplanetary missions. The PRC is increasingly using CNSA efforts
        to bolster relationships with countries around the world, particularly with the BRI
        Partners, providing opportunities to cooperate on space issues.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many space technologies can serve a civilian and military purpose and the PRC
        emphasizes “military-civil fusion”—a phrase used, in part, to refer to the use of dual-use
        technologies, policies, and organizations for military benefit. The SSF works with civilian
        organizations like universities and research organizations to incorporate civilian support
        to military efforts since there is an already high demand for aerospace talent and
        competition for finite human resources. China also has a growing commercial space sector
        that supports government objectives, including remote sensing, launch, and
        communication services.
      </p>
      <p>
        International Cooperation. The PRC has extensive civil space cooperation agreements
        around the world and is an exporter of satellites and space technology. It has more than a
        hundred cooperative space-related agreements with more than three dozen countries and
        four international organizations. The PRC is inviting countries to participate on the
        Chinese space station or International Lunar Research Station, which is jointly led by
        China and Russia, and has sold satellite launching services and ground stations to
        countries around the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        China leads the Asia-Pacific Space Cooperation Organization (APSCO), a multilateral
        organization with rotating leadership whose members include Bangladesh, Iran,
        Mongolia, Pakistan, Peru, Thailand, and Turkey with Egypt, Indonesia, and Mexico as
        associate members. APSCO oversees a network of space surveillance telescopes and
        tasking information, and the observation data it collects is funneled through the Chinese
        Academy of Science’s National Astronomical Observatory of China. The organization is
        planning to improve optical system capabilities, coverage, and redundancy as well as data
        sharing networks.

      <h2>JOINT LOGISTIC SUPPORT FORCE (JLSF)</h2>
      <p><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The JLSF is concentrating its efforts on improving joint strategic and campaign-level
          logistic efficiencies through training and integrating civilian products and services.
        </li>
        <li>
          The JLSF supports multimodal transportation methods to facilitate the movement of
          PLA forces and equipment for training.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The PLA JLSF, established in 2016, provides integrated joint logistics support for the
        PLA. The JLSF commander is Lt. Gen. Wang Liyan. The JLSF is directly subordinate to
        the CMC and is central to China’s efforts to build a joint, efficient “combat-oriented
        modern logistics system,” which Beijing views as essential for modern warfare. The JLSF
        modernizes PLA strategic- and campaign-level logistics by overseeing theater wide
        supply operations, establishing and coordinating support relationships among PLA
        service logistics elements conducting joint logistics exercises with the PLA services, and
        integrating civilian logistics resources into military operations. The JLSF conducts
        exercises to improve the PLA’s ability to conduct joint logistics operations.
      </p>
      <p>
        The JLSF is headquartered at Wuhan Joint Logistics Support Base. It operates five joint
        logistics support centers (JLSCs) aligned with each of the theater commands that are
        intended to streamline logistics support to the PLA. Under the JLSCs’ control are units
        that provide materiel support to the PLA and joint logistics support brigades (JLSBs), who
        focus exclusively on providing mobile logistics support during combat operations.
      </p>
      <p>
        The JLSF provides the PLA with joint strategic- and campaign-level logistics, enabling
        the PLA to conduct large-scale operations. Elements of the JLSF who provide direct
        wartime support to the PLA fighting force are categorized as weapons and ammunition
        storage, warehousing, medical services, transport, fuel, engineering and construction
        management, reserve equipment, and procurement support. During peacetime, the JLSF
        has authority over the JLSCs’ operations and activities; during wartime, theater
        commands possibly would assume control of their designated JLSC.
      </p>
      <p>
        The JLSF integrates civilian resources and equipment into military operations and
        exercises, leveraging China’s civilian products, services and transportation, to improve
        resupply and move military personnel and equipment more rapidly. It does so primarily
        through the use of military representative offices (MROs) comprised of JLSF personnel
        who embed with civilian transportation companies (air, rail, road, and sea) to plan and
        manage military transportation. MRO personnel are vital to the JLSF’s military-civilian
        integration efforts because they understand the technical loading procedures for various
        modes of transportation, can draft load plans, and provide expertise to reduce load times
        at points of embarkation. JLSF theater dispatch centers are the headquarters of regional
        MROs, coordinate PLA mobilization, and are tasked with improving the efficiency of
        transferring materials and forces between transportation modes.
      </p>
      <p>
        PLA Training to Improve Readiness. The CMC sought to improve PLA combat readiness,
        interoperability, and training through the 14th Five-Year Plan and reinforced these
        priorities through military training mobilization orders and senior leadership guidance. In
        2022, Xi emphasized the need for the PLA to adopt the latest technologies in its training
        and to focus on integrating training with combat operations The PLA conducted multiple
        large-scale joint exercises and incorporated advanced weapons and equipment, such as
        during the exercises around Taiwan in August.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout 2022, the PLA sustained the frequency, scale, and duration of joint exercises.
        The COVID-19 pandemic likely did not significantly impact the PLA’s ability to conduct
        joint exercises. The PLA successfully completed at least eight bilateral and multinational
        exercises, conducting naval drills, maritime and aerial patrols, and humanitarian
        assistance and disaster relief efforts. Although the PLA has improved some combat
        deficiencies, the force, as a whole, probably continues to work through challenges with
        joint operations, command and control, and tactical and small-unit leadership.
      </p>
      <p>
        The largest unplanned event of the year occurred in August 2022, when the PLA conducted
        live-fire drills—including firing ballistic missiles over Taiwan—in response to the CODEL
        visit to Taipei in August 2022. During the visit, Taiwan’s defense ministry reported that 27
        PLA aircraft entered Taiwan’s air defense identification zone, including 22 that crossed
        the median of the Taiwan Strait. The PLA’s centerline crossings have continued since
        August as the PLA maintains a heightened readiness level. Such activity reflects ongoing
        PLA attempts to normalize median line crossings.
      </p>

      <h2>INCREASING OPERABILITY WITH PLA RESERVES, PARAMILITARY &amp; MILITIA</h2>
      <p><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Interoperability and integration between the PLA, its reserve components, and the PRC’s
          paramilitary forces continue to grow in scale and sophistication, including the
          coordination between the PLAN, the China Coast Guard (CCG), and the China Maritime
          Militia (CMM).
        </li>
        <li>
          The PRC primarily uses paramilitary maritime organizations in maritime disputes,
          selectively using the PLAN to provide overwatch in case of escalation.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        THE PRC’S INTERNAL SECURITY FORCES
        <br />
        The PRC’s internal security forces consist primarily of the Ministry of Public Security
        (MPS), the Ministry of State Security (MSS), the People’s Armed Police (PAP), the
        People’s Liberation Army (PLA), and the militia. The CCP relies on these forces to
        address challenges ranging from protests over political, social, environmental, or
        economic problems, to terrorism and natural disasters. In 2022, the PRC deployed
        thousands of PLA, PAP, and militia personnel for disaster relief in response to multiple
        events such as an airplane crash, earthquakes, fires, and floods.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ministry of Public Security (MPS). The MPS leads the PRC’s civilian national police,
        which serves as the front force for public order. The key mission of the MPS is domestic
        law enforcement and the “maintenance of social security and order” with duties including
        anti-rioting and anti-terrorism.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ministry of State Security (MSS). The MSS is the PRC’s main civilian intelligence and
        counterintelligence service. MSS operations include but are not limited to: protect the
        PRC’s national security; conduct counterintelligence; combating foreign espionage; and
        investigate organizations or individuals inside the PRC who carry out or direct, support, or
        aid other people perceived to threaten national security. On April 26th, 2021, the PRC
        enacted a new counter-espionage law permitting the MSS authority to identify companies
        and organizations deemed susceptible to foreign infiltration or influence and require
        these institutes to implement measures to prevent foreign infiltration.
      </p>
      <p>
        People’s Armed Police (PAP). The PAP is a paramilitary component of the PRC’s armed
        forces. Its primary missions include internal security, maritime security, and augmentation
        to the PLA during conflict. As part of a security structures reorganization in 2018, the
        CMC centralized control of the PAP. The same reform also subordinated the CCG to the
        PAP.
      </p>
      <p>
        People’s Liberation Army (PLA). In addition to its national defense mission, the PLA has
        formal and informal roles in the PRC’s internal security. As the principal armed wing of
        the CCP, the PLA is the ultimate guarantor of the CCP’s survival and supports other
        internal security forces as necessary. The 2020 National Defense Law recognizes this role
        in assigning the PLA the mission to “consolidate the leadership of the Communist Party
        of China and the socialist system” in addition to external defense tasks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Militia. The PRC’s militia is a force that can be mobilized for a variety of peace- and wartime missions and is distinct from the PLA’s Reserve Force. The militia is organized by
        townships, administrative villages, urban sub-districts, and enterprises and institutions,
        and the missions may vary widely. In wartime, militia units assist the PLA with its military
        operations, conduct independent security operations, and provide support and manpower
        replacement to the PLA. During peacetime, the militia assists in humanitarian aid and
        disaster relief, supports military training, and maintains internal security. The PRC’s
        Military Service Law requires male citizens between 18 to 35 years of age who are fit for
        military service, excluding those already in active service, be enrolled into the militia. The
        militia is divided into two categories. The primary militia consists of former soldiers,
        personnel that have received military training, and personnel selected for military training
        that are under the age of 28, in good health, and politically reliable. The remainder of male
        citizens between 18 and 35 years of age are considered ordinary militia. The primary
        militia may recruit female citizens when necessary and the age limits can be waived under
        special circumstance. Local maritime militia forces, referred to by many western analysts
        as the Chinese Maritime Militia, perform tasks including safeguarding maritime claims,
        protecting fisheries, providing logistic support, search and rescue, and surveillance and
        reconnaissance, often in conjunction or coordination with the PLAN and the CCG.
      </p>
      <p>
        People’s Liberation Army Reserve Force. The People’s Liberation Army Reserve Force
        was founded in 1983 and professionalized throughout the 1990s and 2000s. On July 1st,
        2020, the PRC amended laws, regulations, and policies to bring the Reserve Force under
        the command of the Central Committee of the CCP and the CMC. The previous
        arrangement split control of the Reserve Force between the PLA and local Party
        committees. Motivations for the change include improving combat capability, facilitating
        cooperation with active-duty units, and upholding the CCP’s absolute leadership over the
        military. Chinese sources often stated specifically that the reform would enhance reserve
        performance in Tibet and Xinjiang. Additionally, the PLA appears to have begun making a
        partial restructure towards using a PLAA reserve base system to continue to improve
        facilitation and support for active-duty units.
      </p>
      <p>
        The PLA Reserve Force is comprised of approximately 510,000 personnel subordinate to
        the Army Reserve, Navy Reserve, Air Force Reserve, and Rocket Force Reserve.
        According to PLA documents, active-duty personnel are the backbone of the Reserve
        Force, but reserve-duty officers and soldiers are its foundation. 2020 National Defense
        University's Science of Military Strategy states the building of the reserve force is an
        important part of national defense construction and is the basic and strategic project to
        consolidate national defense. The primary mission of the reserves is to reinforce active-duty
        forces for national defense, with a secondary mission to aid in national disasters or
        maintaining social order.The Reserve Force should be prepared to effectively respond to a
        variety of emergencies and military threats, safeguard national sovereignty, security and
        development interests, and the core security of the country.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although originally founded to support the ground forces, reforms in recent years seek to
        reduce PLAA reserves and increase those for the PLAN, PLAAF, and the PLARF.
        However, PRC writings suggest that, as of 2018, the Reserve Force was still predominately
        ground force-centric, with less than 10 percent of reservists serving specialized technical
        functions in the PLAN, PLAAF, PLARF, or PLA SSF.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reserve officers are selected from veteran PLA officers, local officials, PAP or militia
        officers, and other technical personnel. Reserve soldiers are selected from eligible PLA
        veterans, trained grass-roots militias, and other local or military specialty personnel. Some
        reserve soldiers also failed to meet active-duty entry requirements and conduct remedial
        training in the reserves until they are able to join the active-duty force.
      </p>
      <p>
        The PLA is working to improve reserve mobilization, which anecdotal evidence suggests
        is hindered by unclear processes. In March 2023, during the PRC’s annual “Two
        Sessions,” PLA deputies suggested that the PRC should study and prioritize wartime
        legislation, including the introduction of laws such as the mobilization of reserve forces.
        Chinese documents also suggest that Reserve Force equipment is old; one report in 2018
        stated that more than 70 percent of air defense artillery and artillery equipment is at or
        beyond its maximum service life. Some of the equipment is no longer manufactured and
        repair requires cannibalization.
      </p>
      <p>
        The PLA Reserve Force does not include militias, the Civil Air Defense, or myriad other
        groups (e.g., the People’s Armed Police or the Xinjiang Production and Construction
        Corps (XPCC)).
      </p>
      <h3>PEOPLE'S ARMED POLICE (PAP)</h3>
      <p>
        The PAP is a component of the PRC’s armed forces and an armed wing of the CCP with an
        estimated 660,000 personnel. In the 2020 National Defense University's Science of
        Military Strategy, the primary responsibilities of the PAP include maintaining political,
        institutional and regime security, handling emergency rescue, counter-terrorism, air
        support, maritime rights protection, administrative law enforcement, and defense
        operations. The PAP is organized into three main parts: the Internal Security Corps, the
        Mobile Corps, and the CCG. The Internal Security Corps covers each of the PRC’s
        provinces, provincial-level cities, and “autonomous” regions. There is not yet a reported
        permanent presence of the PAP in the Special Administrative Regions (SARs) of Hong
        Kong or Macao. The Mobile Corps is comprised of myriad PAP units placed to reinforce
        the Internal Security Corps and provide flexibility in responding to internal security
        issues. Mobile Corps units are concentrated around non-Han ethnic regions in the West
        and South (Xinjiang, Tibet, Sichuan, Yunnan, and Qinghai) as well as the major cities of
        Beijing and Shanghai. Xinjiang is a particular focus of the PAP due to alleged separatist
        activity, as well as its proximity to areas of unrest in Central Asia.
      </p>
      <p>
        On July 1st, 2020, the standing committee of the PRC’s legislature, the National People’s
        Congress, approved a revision to the Law on the People’s Armed Police Force which
        officially recognized the CMC singular command of the PAP, identified the PAP as an
        important part of the armed forces that fall under the leadership of the CCP, as well as
        affirming its primary mission set of handling security emergencies, maintaining stability,
        conducting counter-terrorism operations, and executing maritime law enforcement and
        rescue. This legal amendment codified and deepened the substantial reforms of 2018,
        when command of the PAP was centralized under the Central Party Committee and the
        CMC after decades of dual-leadership under the CMC and State Council (a PRC
        government body); the China Coast Guard was subordinated to the PAP; and myriad
        auxiliary duties (e.g., protecting gold mines, firefighting, etc.) were removed from the
        PAP’s purview to focus its mission on PRC domestic and international security. Chinese
        media noted that the 2020 PAP reforms included an article that permitted the PAP to
        conduct certain operations, including counter-terrorism training, outside of the PRC.
      </p>
      <p>
        Xi and the CCP leadership tasked the PAP with integrating themselves into the PLA’s joint
        operation system. The PAP is increasingly focused on internal security and joint operations
        with the PLA and is developing capabilities for rapid response, mobility, and
        counterterrorism operations. The PAP also conducts training with foreign partners,
        including at least Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Russia. Since at least 2016, PAP forces
        have likely operated in Tajikistan, patrolling the tri-border region connecting Tajikistan,
        Afghanistan, and the PRC.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2022, PAP forces performed rescue operations in Xining following major flooding in
        August and in Sichuan after a September 5th earthquake and acquired new helicopters to
        support in counter-terrorism and disaster relief tasks. An emphasis was also placed on PAP
        SOF training throughout the year, including a maritime tactical joint exercise in June with
        PLANMC. Additionally, a PAP officer was named as the commander of the PLA Garrison
        in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, showing a PRC focus of maintaining
        social stability based on the new commander’s counter-terrorism experience in the
        Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
      </p>
      <h3>CHINA COAST GUARD (CCG)</h3>
      <p>
        The CCG is subordinate to the PAP and is responsible for a wide range of maritime
        security missions, including defending the PRC’s sovereignty claims; combating
        smuggling, terrorism, and environmental crimes; as well as supporting international
        cooperation. In 2021, the Standing Committee of China’s National People’s Congress
        passed the Coast Guard Law which took effect on 1 February 2021. The legislation
        regulates the duties of the CCG, to include the use of force, and applies those duties to seas
        under the jurisdiction of the PRC. The law was met with concern by other regional
        countries that may perceive the law as an implicit threat to use force, especially as
        territorial disputes in the region continue.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the law, CCG activity has continued to prompt regional concern. In March 2022, the
        Philippines lodged a diplomatic protest against the PRC after a CCG vessel reportedly
        engaged in “close distance maneuvering” near a Filipino vessel in the disputed Scarborough
        Shoal. In December 2022, Japan reported that CCG vessels stayed in its territorial waters
        for over 72 hours, the longest continuous intrusion since 2012.
      </p>
      <p>
        The CCG’s continued expansion and modernization makes it the largest maritime law
        enforcement fleet in the world. Newer CCG vessels are larger and more capable than older
        vessels, allowing them to operate further offshore and remain on station longer. While
        exact numbers are unavailable, open-source reporting and commercial imagery counts
        indicate the CCG has over 150 regional and oceangoing patrol vessels (more than 1,000
        tons). These larger vessels include over 20 corvettes transferred from the PLAN, which
        were modified for CCG operations. , The newer, larger CCG vessels are equipped with
        helicopter facilities, high-capacity water cannons, multiple interceptor boats and guns
        ranging from 20 to 76 millimeters., Revised estimates indicate the CCG operates more
        than 50 regional patrol combatants (more than 500 tons), which can be used for limited
        offshore operations, and an additional 300 coastal patrol craft (100 to 499 tons).
      </p>
      <h3>CHINA’S MARITIME MILITIA</h3>
      <p>
        China’s Maritime Militia (CMM) is a subset of the PRC’s national militia, an armed reserve
        force of civilians available for mobilization that is ultimately subordinate to the CMC
        through the National Defense Mobilization Department. Throughout China, militia units
        organize around towns, villages, urban sub-districts, and enterprises and vary widely in
        composition and mission. CMM vessels train with and assist the People’s Liberation Army
        Navy (PLAN) and the China Coast Guard (CCG) in tasks such as safeguarding maritime
        claims, surveillance and reconnaissance, fisheries protection, logistics support, and search
        and rescue. These operations traditionally take place within the FIC along China’s coast
        and near disputed features in the SCS such as the Second Thomas Shoal, Scarborough
        Reed, and Luconia Shoal. However, the presence of possible CMM vessels mixed in with
        Chinese fishing vessels near Indonesia’s Natuna Island outside of the “nine-dashed line” on
        Chinese maps indicated a possible ambition to expand CMM operations within the region.
        The PRC employs the CMM in gray zone operations, or “low-intensity maritime rights
        protection struggles,” at a level designed to frustrate effective response by the other
        parties involved. The PRC employs CMM vessels to advance its disputed sovereignty
        claims, often amassing them in disputed areas throughout the SCS and ECS. In this
        manner, the CMM plays a major role in coercive activities to achieve the PRC’s political
        goals without fighting and these operations are part of broader Chinese military theory that
        sees confrontational operations short of war as an effective means of accomplishing
        strategic objectives.
      </p>
      <p>
        CMM units have been active for decades in incidents and combat operations throughout
        China’s near seas and in these incidents CMM vessels are often used to supplement CCG
        cutters at the forefront of the incident, giving the Chinese the capacity to outweigh and
        outlast rival claimants. From September 2021 to September 2022, maritime militia vessels
        were a constant presence near Iroquois Reef in the Spratly Islands within the Philippines
        EEZ. Other notable examples include standoffs with the Malaysia drill ship West Capella
        (2020), defense of China’s HYSY-981 drill rig in waters disputed with Vietnam (2014),
        occupation of Scarborough Reef (2012), and harassment of USNS Impeccable and Howard
        O. Lorenzen (2009 and 2014). Historically, the maritime militia also participated in
        China’s offshore island campaigns in the 1950s, the 1974 seizure of the Paracel Islands
        from South Vietnam, the occupation of Mischief Reef in the Spratly Islands in 1994.
      </p>
      <p>
        The CMM also protects and facilitates Chinese fishing vessels operating in disputed waters.
        From late December 2019 to mid-January 2020, a large fleet of over 50 Chinese fishing
        vessels operated under the escort of multiple China Coast Guard patrol ships in Indonesian
        claimed waters northeast of the Natuna Islands. At least a portion of the Chinese ships in
        this fishing fleet were affiliated with known traditional maritime militia units, including a
        maritime militia unit based out of Beihai City in Guangxi province. While most traditional
        maritime militia units operating in the SCS continue to originate from townships and ports
        on Hainan Island, Beihai is one of a number of increasingly prominent maritime militia
        units based out of provinces in mainland China. These mainland based maritime militia
        units routinely operate in the Spratly Islands and in the southern SCS, and their operations
        in these areas are enabled by increased funding from the Chinese government to improve
        their maritime capabilities and grow their ranks of personnel.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>By 2014, the PRC had begun a new practice: small-scale reclamation in the
        Spratlys using the Maritime Militia.</strong> (See excerpt below)
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          CMM AND LAND RECLAMATION IN THE SOUTH CHINA SEA
        </strong>
        <br />
        Since at least 2014, CMM vessels have engaged in covert small scale reclamation activity
        and likely caused physical changes observed at multiple unoccupied features in the
        Spratly Islands, including Lankiam Cay, Eldad Reef, Sandy Cay, and Whitsun Reef.
        Beijing likely is attempting to covertly alter these features so that it can portray them as
        naturally formed high tide elevations capable of supporting PRC maritime claims out to
        the farthest extent of the nine-nash line. In contrast to the PRC large-scale reclamation
        program, which was overt and where the original status of occupied features is well
        documented, the less well-known historical record about many of the unoccupied features
        makes them more susceptible to PRC efforts to shape international opinion regarding the
        status of the features.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through the National Defense Mobilization Department, Beijing subsidizes various local
        and provincial commercial organizations to operate CMM vessels to perform “official”
        missions on an ad hoc basis outside of their regular civilian commercial activities. CMM
        units employ marine industry workers, usually fishermen, as a supplement to the PLAN and
        the CCG. While retaining their day jobs, these mariners are organized and trained, often by
        the PLAN and the CCG, and can be activated on demand.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since 2014, China has built a new Spratly backbone fleet comprising at least 235 large
        steel-hulled fishing vessels, many longer than 50 meters and displacing more than 500
        tons. These vessels were built under central direction from the PRC government to operate
        in disputed areas south of 12 degrees latitude that China typically refers to as the “Spratly
        Waters,” including the Spratly Islands and southern SCS. Spratly backbone vessels were
        built for prominent CMM units in Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hainan Provinces. For vessel
        owners not already affiliated with CMM units, joining the militia was a precondition for
        receiving government funding to build new Spratly backbone boats. As with the CCG and
        PLAN, new facilities in the Paracel and Spratly Islands enhance the CMM’s ability to
        sustain operations in the SCS.
      </p>
      <p>
        Starting in 2015, the Sansha City Maritime Militia in the Paracel Islands has been developed
        into a salaried full-time maritime militia force with its own command center and equipped
        with at least 84 purpose-built vessels armed with mast-mounted water cannons for
        spraying and reinforced steel hulls for ramming. Freed from their normal fishing
        responsibilities, Sansha City Maritime Militia personnel – many of whom are former PLAN
        and CCG sailors – train for peacetime and wartime contingencies, often with light arms,
        and patrol regularly around disputed South China Sea features even during fishing
        moratoriums.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Tanmen Maritime Militia is another prominent CMM unit. Homeported in Tanmen
        township on Hainan Island, the formation was described by Xi as a “model maritime
        militia unit” during a visit to Tanmen harbor in 2013. During the visit, Xi encouraged
        Tanmen to support “island and reef development” in the SCS. Between 1989 and 1995, the
        Tanmen Maritime Militia, under the authority of the PLAN Southern Theater Navy (then
        the South Sea Fleet), was involved in the occupation and reclamation of PRC outposts in
        the Spratly Islands, including Subi Reef, Fiery Cross Reef, and Mischief Reef.
      </p>
      <h3>SPECIAL OPERATIONS FORCES</h3>
      <p><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Despite unilateral and multilateral training, all of China’s SOF units lack real-world
          combat experience.
        </li>
        <li>
          China’s SOF does not have a national-level special operations command to oversee all
          of China’s SOF activities.
        </li>
        <li>
          Despite an emphasis to conduct joint training, theater commanders have no authority
          over PAP units, making it difficult to incorporate PAP SOF into PLA training exercises.
        </li>
        <li>
          The PRC categorizes its non-traditional security threats as terrorism (domestic and
          international), separatism (entities looking to break away from China such Taiwan,
          Tibet, and the Uyghur minority population in western China), and extremism (primarily
          religious).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In late 2015, the PRC’s SOF were impacted by a series of reforms that aimed to “reorganize
        troops and rebuild new-type combat forces. New types of combat forces have been
        enhanced to conduct special operations, all-dimensional offense and defense, amphibious
        operations, far seas protection, and strategic projection, aiming to make the force
        composition complete, combined, multi-functional, and flexible.” In 2016, additional
        changes to Chinese law were made authorizing the PRC’s SOF to conduct operations
        outside of China’s borders.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Mission.</strong> The PRC’s SOF are tasked to conduct three primary missions; direct
        action, special reconnaissance, and counterterrorism. The goal of the PRC’s SOF
        operations are to prepare the battlefield for their conventional force counterparts by
        attacking critical areas, degrading enemy operational systems and capabilities, and
        delaying or disrupting enemy operational activities. In conventional warfare, the PRC’s
        SOF missions include, but are not limited to, disrupting rear echelon formations and
        activities, destroying or securing key targets, decapitation, and targeting for fire support.
        The PRC’s SOF can also conduct humanitarian aid and disaster relief (HADR) missions,
        noncombatant evacuation operations (NEO), and personal security assignments. While
        PLA SOF can conduct counterterrorism missions, PAP SOF are specifically tasked with
        this mission. The PRC categorizes its non-traditional security threats as terrorism
        (domestic and international), separatism (entities looking to break away from China such
        Taiwan, Tibet, and the Uyghur minority population in western China), and extremism
        (primarily religious).

      <p>
        ● <strong>PLA Army SOF.</strong> PLAA SOF train to clear obstacles, operate behind enemy
        lines, land navigation, reconnaissance, targeting, blocking maneuvers, and first aid.
        PLAA SOF units from the Eastern Theater Command train for maritime missions by
        swimming, maneuvering small rubber boats, marksmanship from moving boats, and scuba
        diving. In a 2016 exercise, forces from a Southern Theater Command Army SOF Brigade
        (BDE) conducted an air assault mission off the coast then traveled 5 km to the shoreline.
      </p>
      <p>
        ● In September 2020, attack and transport helicopters from the 73rd Army Group (GA)
        conducted air assault training with elements from a 73rd GA SOF BDE.
      </p>
      <p>
        ● That same month, elements from a Southern Theater Command SOF BDE deployed to a
        new training area and conducted a command post exercise and force-on-force exercise.
      </p>
      <p>
        ● <strong>PLA Navy Marine Corps SOF.</strong> PLANMC SOF are trained to conduct
        ground-based special operations, as well as coastal and maritime missions, including
        maritime counterterrorism, HADR, NEO and visit, board, search and seizure operations.
        They train for more than a year learning airborne, rappelling, reconnaissance, secure
        communication, navigation, driving, search and seizure, demolition, and hand-to-hand
        combat skills. They also practice deploying rubber boats and fast-roping from helicopters
        into the water. In December 2020, PLANMC SOF participated in a combined arms island
        seizure exercise with mechanized infantry units where the SOF used mine-clearing line
        charges to destroy obstacles with sniper teams in overwatch.
      </p>
      <p>
        ● <strong>PLA Air Force Airborne Corps SOF.</strong> The PLAAF Airborne Corps, created
        in 2011, train to conduct high-altitude, high-opening and high-altitude, low-opening
        airborne missions for critical target seizure, combat search and rescue, and fire support
        coordination during extraction.
      </p>
      <p>
        ● <strong>PLA Rocket Force Reconnaissance Regiment.</strong> The PLARF Reconnaissance
        Regiment which is based in Qinghai, can conduct air, land, and sea missions including
        counter-ISR, strategic asset protection, special reconnaissance, and target acquisition.
      </p>
      <p>
        ● <strong>People’s Armed Police SOF.</strong> The PAP has three main SOF units assigned
        to the two mobile contingents and the Xinjiang Military District. The Mountain Eagle
        Commando Unit created in 2019 and based in Xinjiang is trained to conduct
        counterterrorism missions within the province. The other two PAP SOF units, the Snow
        Leopards Commando Unit and the Falcon Commando Unit, are large rapid reaction forces
        with mixed capabilities that can be deployed in major contingencies on a national level.
        These units are also trained to conduct counterterrorism missions along with hostage
        rescue, and include assault, reconnaissance, explosive ordnance disposal, and sniper
        teams. The Snow Leopards have strict selection standards with a 40-50 percent of recruits
        failing the initial screening. The Snow Leopards’ annual “Devil Week” training simulates
        counterterrorism missions in multiple combat environments including desert, jungle,
        urban terrain, air, and sea.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Personnel.</strong> The PRC’s SOF currently has between 20,000 and 30,000
        personnel. The PRC’s SOF units are comprised of experienced officers and noncommissioned officers but are also assigned new conscripts and officers that recently
        graduated from basic training or military academy, including the Special Operations
        Academy in Guangzhou. SOF conscripts are selected from volunteers suggesting they are
        among the most qualified that commit to a two-year term of service. After their two-year
        commitment, the conscripts are offered to continue service as noncommissioned officers.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Structure and Organization.</strong> Beginning in January 2016, the PLA underwent
        several reforms that impacted the PLA SOF. The seven military regions were reorganized
        into five theater commands (TC) and five of the 18 GA were deactivated. The PLA SOF
        were also reorganized assigning a SOF BDE to each GA along with a SOF BDE for the
        Xinjiang and Tibet Military Districts. These and later reforms also impacted the PLARF
        Reconnaissance Regiment, the PLAAF Airborne Corps SOF BDE, and the PAP SOF units.
        Some of these SOF units are relatively new and were created using conventional forces to
        expand the PLA’s SOF capability. All PLA SOF units are supported by the PLA Air
        Force’s 15th Airborne Corps for tactical insertion, extraction, and resupply.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each PLA SOF BDE has between 2,000 and 3,000 personnel while a regiment has between
        1,000 and 2,000 personnel. While PLA SOF units have discrete missions based on branch
        and location, their internal structure resembles the PLA Army brigade-battalion-companyteam construct with a main, reserve, and rear command structure.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are three SOF units within the PAP which have a total of six detachments. Three
        detachments are assigned to the 1st Mobile Contingent based in Beijing, two detachments
        are assigned to the 2nd Mobile Contingent based in Guangzhou, and one detachment falls
        under the Xinjiang Internal Contingent.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is no national-level special operations command responsible for all SOF activities.
        PLA SOF also does not have organic or dedicated infrastructure or support and therefore
        must rely on conventional forces to support their missions whereas the PAP does have an
        internal logistic support system to support its SOF missions.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Internal Training and Exercises.</strong> The PRC’s SOF focus on individual and
        squad-level training; however, they have participated in larger combined arms and joint
        exercises. SOF training entails physical fitness training, close quarters combat, individual
        and team survival, camouflage, weapons proficiency, land navigation, and communication.
        All PRC SOF units are airborne and air assault capable.
      </p>
      <p>
        The recent reforms under Xi gave theater commanders authority over a wider range of
        forces including PLA SOF and also emphasized joint training. However, these reforms did
        not create joint task forces which might encourage increased coordination between the
        services. The restructuring to theater commands has not resulted in increased integration
        of PLA SOF into joint training. There is scant evidence of PRC’s SOF units from different
        services training together or with conventional forces, the exception being PLAAF
        aircraft for PLAA SOF airborne training. There is also no evidence that PAP SOF units
        have participated in joint exercises with any PLA forces. Theater commanders have no
        authority over PAP units, making it difficult to incorporate PAP SOF into PLA training
        exercises.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>External Training and Exercises.</strong> In 2002, the PLA began participating in
        multinational training exercises and since then, PRC’s SOF personnel and units, to include
        PAP SOF, have taken part in several foreign events, primarily focused on
        counterterrorism. Some of these events were held with units from Belarus, India,
        Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Mongolia, Russia, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Jordan.
        Individual PLA SOF personnel and small units have participated in training in Israel,
        Turkey, Estonia, Colombia, and Venezuela In August 2021, PLA SOF participated in joint
        training exercise “Zapad” with their Russian counterparts to help maintain security and
        stability in the Transbaikal region. Supported by Y-20 transport aircraft, PLA SOF focused
        their training on large-scale airborne exercises including heavy equipment insertion. Of
        note, the PAP’s Snow Leopards have won the International Warrior Competition held at
        Jordan’s King Abdullah II Special Operations Training Centre in Amman several times.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Equipment and Sustainment.</strong> The PRC’s SOF units are equipped with the
        most modern domestically-produced weapons and equipment. These include advanced
        communication and electronics, unmanned aerial systems ranging from micro-UAVs to
        the medium-altitude long endurance platforms, night vision devices, targeting devices,
        parachutes, and light vehicles, boats, and aircraft. PLA SOF units tasked with conducting
        clandestine maritime missions are also equipped with diver navigation aids, radios,
        undersea sensors, diver propulsion systems, underwater personnel delivery systems, and
        handheld direction-finding sonars for low-visibility underwater environments.

        PLA SOF do not have an internal support system to conduct missions and relies on the
        theater command to meet their logistical needs whereas the PAP has an internal logistic
        system separate from the PLA to meet their sustainment needs during operations.

        <strong>Operational Capabilities.</strong> Most PLA ground SOF units appear to be elite
        light infantry units that can be inserted behind enemy lines but are limited by their
        conventional force counterpart’s ability to support their mission. PLA SOF brigades
        emphasize a “centralized command style”—common in conventional units—as opposed to
        a more flexible “task-oriented command style” via radio and satellite communications.
        PLA Army SOF brigades also include liaison officers from pertinent PLA Navy, Air
        Force, Rocket Force, and aviation units in their command post to facilitate SOF missions
        in support of theater command operations. PLA SOF brigades also face the same C2 issues
        that conventional PLA brigades encounter. One example from 2019 showed that voice
        communications were difficult to maintain using single-function and limited bandwidth
        radios and satellite communications terminals. This limited communication between the
        brigade and below conventional forces as well as the supporting SOF battalion and below
        forces.

        Many U.S. SOF activities do not fall within the purview of China’s SOF missions. PLA
        SOF do not conduct military information support operations (also known as psychological
        operations). These operations are conducted by elements within the PLA Political
        Department System. However, PLA SOF units may assist in larger information support
        operations, but would not be in command. PLA SOF also do not have units equivalent to
        U.S. Army Civil Affairs units.

        Humanitarian aid and disaster relief (HADR) is a mission conducted by all PLA, PAP, and
        militia units in conjunction with local civilian authorities. The PRC’s SOF may provide
        support in the form of communications and reconnaissance in remote areas, but would not
        be the lead agency for HADR missions.
      </p>

        Both the PLAA and PLAAF lack aviation assets to conduct long-range insertions of PLA
        SOF to conduct strategic-level direct action or reconnaissance, but they can conduct air
        insertions of SOF in support of theater operations. Helicopters are used to transport SOF
        for airborne and air assault missions. All PLA airborne-qualified SOF train in fixed-wing
        aircraft, such as the Yun-5 biplane, which can also be used for SOF missions. However,
        the PLA’s shortage of long-range, heavy transport aircraft means PLA Air Force units
        receive priority to use these aircraft for airborne training.

        <strong>Employment.</strong> Since 2008, approximately 70 PLANMC SOF personnel have
        deployed to the Gulf of Aden aboard PLAN vessels as part of the PRC’s counterpiracy
        operations. In 2015, PLA SOF conducted search and rescue, medical evacuation, and force
        protection operations in Nepal following an earthquake. Also in 2015, PLANMC SOF
        helped evacuate foreign nationals due to the war in Yemen and in 2017, PLANMC SOF
        recaptured a hijacked freighter from Somali pirates in the Gulf of Aden. In 2020, PLA SOF
        from the Tibet Military Region deployed to the border with India following clashes
        between Chinese and Indian forces along the LAC.

      </p>
      <p><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The PLA is aggressively developing capabilities to provide options for the PRC to
          dissuade, deter, or, if ordered, defeat third-party intervention in the Indo-Pacific
          region.
        </li>
        <li>
          The PLA continues developing the capabilities to conduct military operations deeper
          into the Indo-Pacific region and globally.
        </li>
        <li>
          The PLA has undertaken important structural reforms and introduced new military
          doctrine to strengthen joint operations and is testing joint capabilities in and beyond
          the FIC.
