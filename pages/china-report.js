      <h1>EAST CHINA SEA (ECS)</h1>
      <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
      <p>● The PRC continues to use maritime law enforcement ships and aircraft to patrol near the Japan-administered Senkaku Islands.</p>
      <p>● The PRC attempts to legitimize its claims in the ECS through the continuous presence of PRC fishing and Maritime Militia vessels, escorted by CCG cutters and with PLA Navy warships nearby as overwatch.</p>
      <p>● In 2021, the PRC passed new legislation regarding the rules of engagement for their Coast Guard vessels, which created a legal justification for more aggressive patrols. Throughout 2021 and 2022, the PRC expanded its annual unilateral summer fishing ban in Beijing-claimed waters north of the 12th parallel to include the ECS by an additional month to incrementally enforce its de facto maritime sovereignty claims.</p>

      <p>
        The PRC claims sovereignty over the Japanese-administered Senkaku Islands in the ECS,
        which Taiwan also claims. Beijing continues to uphold the importance of the 2014 four-point
        consensus, which states Japan and the PRC will acknowledge divergent positions over the ECS
        but prevent escalation through dialogue, consultation, and crisis management mechanisms. The
        United States does not take a position on sovereignty of the Senkaku Islands but recognizes
        Japan’s administration of the islands and continues to reaffirm that the islands fall within
        the scope of Article 5 of the U.S.-Japan Mutual Security Treaty. In addition, the United
        States opposes any unilateral actions that seek to undermine Japan’s administration of the
        islands.
      </p>
      <p>
        The PRC uses maritime law enforcement ships and aircraft to patrol near the Senkaku Islands,
        not only to demonstrate its sovereignty claims, but also to improve readiness and responsiveness
        to potential contingencies. In 2022, the PRC continued to conduct regular patrols into the
        contiguous zone territorial seas around the Senkaku Islands and stepped up efforts to challenge
        Japan’s control over the islands by increasing the duration and assertiveness of its patrols.
        For the third year in a row, CCG ships entered Japanese-claimed waters for more than 100
        consecutive days, including over 300 days in the contiguous zones around the Islands in 2022.
        In December 2022, the CCG conducted the longest entrance to date into the Senkaku Islands
        territorial waters, with four ships remaining in the waters for nearly 73 hours. The previous
        record for territorial waters entrance duration was 64 hours, set in July 2022. The increased
        PRC assertiveness around the Senkaku Islands caused Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida to
        express “grave concern” in November to President Xi during the first meeting between Chinese
        and Japanese leaders since December 2019. The two leaders agreed to reestablish a maritime and
        aerial hotline between the two countries’ militaries to resume security dialogue, which the two
        defense ministers later used for the first time in May 2023.

      <h1>SOUTHERN THEATER COMMAND</h1>
      <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
      <p>● The Southern Theater Command is oriented toward the SCS, Southeast Asia border security, and territorial and maritime disputes.</p>
      <p>● The Southern Theater Command is responsible for responding to U.S. freedom of navigation operations in the SCS and can assume command as needed over all CCG and CMM ships conducting operations within the PRC’s claimed “nine-dash line.”</p>
      <p>● In 2022, Southern Theater Command units conducted multiple live-fire drills and amphibious training events near PRC-occupied features in the SCS.</p>

      <p>
        The Southern Theater Command covers mainland and maritime Southeast Asia, including the SCS.
        This geographic area implies that the Southern Theater Command is responsible for securing
        the SCS, supporting the Eastern Theater Command in any operation against Taiwan, and assuring
        the security of sea lines of communication (SLOCs) vital to China’s global ambitions in the
        SCS. The Southern Theater Command is responsible for responding to U.S. freedom of navigation
        operations in the SCS by regularly tracking and reacting to U.S. ships operating within the
        China-claimed “nine-dash line.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The Southern Theater Command is responsible for training, force disposition, and operations in
        the SCS. The Southern Theater Command also plays a significant role in the PLA’s bilateral and
        multilateral exercises with countries in Southeast Asia, such as participating in humanitarian
        assistance and disaster relief exercise with Thailand in 2022.
      </p>
      <p>
        The PLA Hong Kong and Macao garrisons are subordinate to the Southern Theater Command. In
        August 2022, the PLA Hong Kong and Macao garrisons conducted an annual rotation of forces.
        Since 1997, the PLA has rotated forces by land, air, and sea from Shenzhen at night, nominally
        as part of the usual annual rotation. Since the 2019 pro-democracy protests, China maintains
        a rotational deployment of PAP forces in Hong Kong. The PAP and PLA units continued to publicly
        highlight their anti-riot, counterterrorism, and disaster prevention training.
      </p>
      <p>
        All of the PLA’s 24 Su-35s purchased from Russia are assigned to the Southern Theater Command
        Air Force and have flown patrols in the SCS and into the Western Pacific. The Southern Theater
        Command was also the first command to receive the PLAN’s H-6J maritime strike bombers. In
        December 2019, the PRC commissioned its first-domestically produced aircraft carrier, Shandong
        into service at Yulin Naval Base in the Southern Theater Command. In April, the Shandong
        conducted its first training exercise in the Philippine Sea with J-15 aircraft entering Taiwan’s
        air defense identification zone for the first time, demonstrating the PLA’s increased capabilities
        further from China’s borders.

      <h1>PLA Force Laydown in Southern Theater Command</h1>

      <h1>SOUTH CHINA SEA (SCS)</h1>
      <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
      <p>● The PRC’s outposts on the Spratly Islands are capable of supporting military operations, including advanced weapon systems, and have supported non-combat aircraft. However, no large-scale presence of combat aircraft has been yet observed at airfields on the outposts.</p>
      <p>● In 2022, the PRC continued to deploy PLAN, CCG, and civilian ships in response to Vietnamese and Malaysian drilling operations within the PRC’s claimed “Nine-DashLine,” the Philippines’ construction at Thitu Island, and the Philippines’ resupply missions to Second Thomas Shoal.</p>

      <h2>DEVELOPMENTS IN THE SECURITY SITUATION IN THE SCS</h2>
      <p>
        In July 2016, pursuant to provisions in the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea
        (UNCLOS), an arbitral tribunal convened at the Philippines’ behest, ruled that the PRC’s claims
        to “historic rights” in the SCS, depicted by the “nine-dash line,” were not compatible with
        UNCLOS. Since December 2019, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam have explicitly
        referenced the arbitral ruling in notes verbales to the UN denying the validity of the PRC’s
        “historic rights” and nine-dash line claims. Beijing, however, categorically rejects the
        tribunal decision, and the PRC continues to use coercive tactics, including the employment of
        PLA naval, coast guard, and paramilitary vessels, to enforce its claims. The PRC does so in
        ways calculated to remain below the threshold of provoking conflict. In 2022, the PRC continued
        to impose a yearly, unilateral three-month fishing ban that includes the waters inside the EEZ
        of the Philippines and Vietnam to incrementally enforce its de facto maritime claims.
      </p>
      <p>
        ● The PRC states that international military presence within the SCS is a challenge to its
        sovereignty. Throughout 2022, the PRC deployed PLAN, CCG, and civilian ships to maintain a
        presence in disputed areas, such as near Scarborough Reef and Thitu Island, as well as in
        response to oil and gas exploration operations by rival claimants within the PRC’s claimed
        “nine-dash line.” Separately, the CCG and People's Armed Forces Maritime Militia (PAFMM) used
        nets and ropes to block Philippine supply boats on their way to an atoll in the SCS and issued
        radio challenges and threats to Philippine ships during routine resupply missions.
      </p>
      <p>
        ● In November 2022, a CCG vessel forcibly seized apparent PRC rocket debris that had fallen
        near Philippine-occupied Thitu Island from the Philippines by cutting the tow line of a
        Philippine Navy vessel as it was towing debris back to shore. PRC insisted the debris was
        returned to them after a “friendly negotiation,” despite the Philippines producing video
        evidence of the incident and issues diplomatic notes of protest.
      </p>
      <p>
        ● In March 2022, the Philippines lodged a diplomatic protest after a CCG ship maneuvered
        within 21 meters of a Filipino vessel near Scarborough Shoal. This was the fourth time in
        under a year that the CCG had maneuvered dangerously close to Philippine vessels.
      </p>
      <p>
        ● In December 2022, the Philippines expressed serious concern over reports that the PRC had
        reclaimed several unoccupied land features in the SCS, notably at four features in the Spratly
        Islands. The Philippines noted that new construction contravenes the Declaration of Conduct on
        the South China Sea’s undertaking on self-restraint and the 2016 Arbitral Award, while Beijing
        denied any actions and emphasized dialogue between the two nations.

      <h2>Outposts in the Spratly Islands<br/>SCS OUTPOSTS CAPABLE OF SUPPORTING MILITARY OPERATIONS</h2>
      <p>
        Since early 2018, the PRC-occupied Spratly Islands outposts have been equipped with advanced
        anti-ship and anti-aircraft missile systems and military jamming equipment, representing the
        most capable land-based weapons systems deployed by any claimant in the disputed SCS areas to
        date. In mid-2021, the PLA deployed an intelligence-gathering ship and a surveillance aircraft
        to the Spratly Islands during U.S.-Australia bilateral operations in the region. From early
        2018 through 2022, the PRC regularly used its Spratly Islands outposts to support naval and
        coast guard operations in the SCS. The PRC has added more than 3,200 acres of land to the seven
        features it occupies in the Spratlys. China has also added military infrastructure, including
        72 aircraft hangars, docks, satellite communication equipment, antenna array, radars, and
        hardened shelters for missile platforms.
      </p>
      <p>
        The PRC has stated these projects are mainly to improve marine research, safety of navigation,
        and the living and working conditions of personnel stationed on the outposts. However, the
        outposts provide airfields, berthing areas, and resupply facilities that allow the PRC to
        maintain a more flexible and persistent military and paramilitary presence in the area. This
        improves the PRC’s ability to detect and challenge activities by rival claimants or third
        parties and widens the range of response options available to Beijing.

      <h1>WESTERN THEATER COMMAND</h1>
      <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
      <p>● The Western Theater Command is oriented toward India and counterterrorism missions along China’s Central Asia borders.</p>
      <p>● The Western Theater Command focuses on Xinjiang and Tibet Autonomous Regions, where the CCP perceives a high threat of separatism and terrorism, particularly among Uyghur populations in Xinjiang.</p>
      <p>● Since early May 2020, sustained tensions along the India-China border have dominated the Western Theater Command’s attention, including at least one border clash in December 2022 along the PRC border with India’s Arunachal Pradesh state that injured multiple soldiers.</p>

      <p>
        The Western Theater Command is geographically the largest theater command within the PRC and
        is responsible for responding to conflict with India and what the PRC refers to as “terrorist
        threats” in western China. PLA units located within the Western Theater Command include 76th
        and 77th Group Armies and ground forces subordinate to Xinjiang and Xizang Military Districts;
        three PLAAF bases, one transportation division, one flying academy, and one PLARF base.
      </p>
      <p>
        Within China, the Western Theater Command focuses on Xinjiang and Tibet Autonomous Regions,
        where the CCP perceives a high threat of separatism and terrorism, particularly among Uyghur
        populations in Xinjiang. According to the U.S. Department of State’s 2022 Country Reports on
        Human Rights Practices, in the PRC, “genocide and crimes against humanity occurred during the
        year against the predominantly Muslim Uyghurs and other ethnic and religious minority groups
        in Xinjiang.” Authorities were reported to have arbitrarily detained more than one million
        ethnic Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and other Muslims in extrajudicial internment camps designed
        to erase religious and ethnic identities. Although PRC government officials justified the camps
        under the pretense of “combatting terrorism, separatism, and extremism,” information from the
        international community, including the UN, refute such justifications. Moreover, oppression of
        Muslim Uyghurs and other ethnic and religious minority groups in Xinjiang is likely used by
        extremist organizations as a propaganda and recruiting tool, generating new threats to the
        region.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since early May 2020, sustained tensions along the India-China border have dominated the
        Western Theater Command’s attention. Differing perceptions between India and the PRC
        regarding border demarcations along the LAC, combined with recent infrastructure construction
        on both sides, led to multiple clashes, an ongoing standoff, and military buildups along the
        shared border. In response to a skirmish in June 2020 between PRC and Indian patrols in Galwan
        Valley, the most violent clash between the two countries in 45 years, the Western Theater
        Command implemented a large-scale mobilization and deployment of PLA forces along the LAC.
        Commander-level negotiations meant to reduce tensions continued in December 2022 with the
        17th round of talks. The Western Theater Command’s deployments along the LAC will likely
        continue through 2023.

      </p>

      <h2>CHINA-INDIA BORDER</h2>
      <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
      <p>● In 2022, the PLA increased the deployment of forces and continued infrastructure build up along the LAC.</p>
      <p>● Negotiations between India and the PRC made minimal progress as both sides resisted losing perceived advantages on the border.</p>
      <p>
        Beginning in May 2020, PRC and Indian forces faced off in clashes with rocks, batons, and clubs
        wrapped in barbed wire at multiple locations along the LAC. The resulting standoff triggered
        the buildup of forces on both sides of the disputed border. Each country demanded the
        withdrawal of the other’s forces and a return to pre-standoff conditions, but neither China
        nor India agreed on those conditions. The PRC blamed the standoff on Indian infrastructure
        construction, which it perceived as encroaching on PRC territory, while India accused China
        of launching aggressive incursions into India’s territory. On 15 June 2020, patrols violently
        clashed in Galwan Valley and resulted in the death of approximately 20 Indian soldiers and
        four PLA soldiers. This incident was the deadliest clash between the two since the 1962
        Sino-Indian War. Following the 2020 clash, the PLA has maintained continuous force presence
        and continued infrastructure build up along the LAC.
      </p>
      <p>
        ● In 2022, China continued to develop military infrastructure along the LAC. These
        improvements include underground storage facilities near Doklam, new roads in all three
        sectors of the LAC, new villages in disputed areas in neighboring Bhutan, a second bridge
        over Pangong Lake, a dual-purpose airport near the center sector, and multiple helipads.
      </p>
      <p>
        ● In 2022, China deployed one border regiment, supported by two divisions of Xinjiang and
        Tibet Military Districts with four combined arms brigades (CAB) in reserve in the western
        sector of the LAC. China also deployed as many as three light-to-medium CABs in the eastern
        sector from other theater commands and an additional three CABs in the central sector of the
        LAC. Although some elements of a light CAB eventually withdrew, a majority of the deployed
        forces remain in place along the LAC.
      </p>
      <p>
        ● On July 17th, China and India held the 16th round of Corps Commander-level talks focusing
        on the resolution of border disagreements in the western sector of the LAC. Both sides agreed
        to withdraw forces from the Gogra-Hotsprings area of the LAC and to maintain dialogue through
        military and diplomatic channels to reach a mutually acceptable solution to the remaining
        border issues. Two previous rounds of Corps Commander-level talks in March and January made
        no progress to resolve the China-India border dispute.
      </p>
      <p>
        ● On September 8th, Chinese and Indian forces began to withdraw from the Gogra-Hotsprings
        area along the western sector of the LAC. This withdrawal was the direct result of the 16th
        round of Corps Commander-level talks held in July.
      </p>
      <p>
        ● On October 14th, representatives from China and India attended a virtual 25th Meeting of
        Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC). Both sides lauded the recent
        withdrawal of forces from the border and agreed to take measures to reduce border tension
        and shift from emergency response to regular management of the border areas. The 24th WMCC
        was held on 31 May with no significant progress being made to disengage from the western
        sector of the LAC.
      </p>
      <p>
        ● On 9 December, hundreds of Chinese and Indian forces clashed along the eastern sector of the
        LAC near the Yangtse area of Tawang, India. Both sides previously agreed to not use firearms
        along the border—instead they use sticks and clubs as weapons—however both Chinese and
        Indian forces sustained injuries. Media reports described the skirmish as the worst since the
        2020 Galwan Valley incident.
      </p>
      <p>
        ● On 20 December, China and India held the 17th round of Corps Commander-level talks at the
        Chushul-Moldo border meeting point in China. This round of talks was not announced—unlike
        previous talks—and came 10 days after Chinese and Indian forces clashed along the eastern
        sector of the LAC near the Yangtse area of Tawang, India. No agreements were made during this
        meeting and both sides pledged to continue dialogue through military and diplomatic channels.

      <h1>NORTHERN THEATER COMMAND</h1>
      <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
      <p>● The Northern Theater Command is oriented toward the Korean Peninsula and Russian border security.</p>
      <p>● In September 2022, the Northern Theater Command sent a 2,000 member contingent of army, navy, and air force units to participate in the Russia-hosted multi-national military exercise Vostok-2022.</p>
      <p>
        The Northern Theater Command includes the PRC’s provinces bordering Mongolia, Russia, North
        Korea, and the Yellow Sea. It is responsible for operations along China’s northern periphery
        and border security associated with North Korean, Russia, and Mongolia. PLA units located
        within the Northern Theater Command include the 78th, 79th, and 80th Group Armies; the
        Northern Theater Navy and its naval aviation division and two marine brigades; and two
        operational PLAAF bases, one special mission aircraft division, and one flying academy; and
        one PLARF base.
      </p>
      <p>
        During a contingency, the Northern Theater Command likely exercises command over some SSF
        units in theater and receives strategic intelligence support from the SSF to improve
        battlefield awareness and facilitate joint operations within the theater. The North Sea Fleet
        is responsible primarily for protecting the sea approaches to northern China but could provide
        mission-critical assets to support other fleets during contingencies located beyond the
        Northern Theater. In 2022, Northern Theater Command forces conducted various joint and single
        service training activities including carrier navigation and flight training, and likely
        conducted UAS training.

      <h1>CENTRAL THEATER COMMAND</h1>
      <h2>Key Takeaway</h2>
      <p>● The Central Theater Command’s mission is the defense of Beijing while providing support to other theater commands.</p>
      <p>
        The Central Theater Command’s primary responsibility is to defend the capital and CCP leadership
        while providing a strategic reserve to the other theater commands. It is centrally located,
        connecting the four remaining theater commands. Major military units under the Central Theater
        Command military include the PLAA’s 81st, 82nd, and 83rd Group Armies; and the PLAAF’s 13th
        Transport Division, 34th VIP Transport Division, 36th Bomber Division, 15th Airborne Corps, and
        the Shijiazhuang Flying Academy. Other assets in the Central Theater Command include PLA Rocket
        Force and the Wuhan and Datong Bases.

      <h2>DEVELOPMENTS IN THE SECURITY SITUATION IN THE TAIWAN STRAIT</h2>
      <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
      <p>● In 2022, the PRC amplified diplomatic, political, and military pressure against Taiwan.</p>
      <p>● Throughout 2022, the PLA increased provocative and destabilizing actions in and around the Taiwan Strait, to include ballistic missile overflights of Taiwan, sharply increased flights into Taiwan’s self-declared ADIZ and a series of major military exercises near Taiwan.</p>
      <p>
        Throughout 2022, the PRC conducted large-scale joint military exercises focused on training
        to deter further U.S. and allied operations along China’s periphery. Many of these exercises
        focused on combat realism and have featured night missions, training in extreme weather, and
        simultaneous multi-domain operations.
      </p>
      <p>
        The PLA is preparing for a contingency to unify Taiwan with the PRC by force if perceived as
        necessary by Beijing, while simultaneously deterring, delaying, or denying any third-party
        intervention, such as the United States and/or other like-minded partners, on Taiwan’s behalf.
        As part of a comprehensive campaign to pressure Taiwan and the Tsai administration and signal
        its displeasure at deepening Washington-Taipei ties, the PRC has persistently conducted military
        operations near Taiwan and military training for a Taiwan contingency. Throughout 2022, the
        PLA increased provocative actions in and around the Taiwan Strait, to include ballistic missile
        overflights of Taiwan, significantly increased flights into Taiwan’s self-declared air defense
        identification zone, and conducted a series of large-scale military exercises around Taiwan.
      </p>
      <p>
        ● According to Taiwan Ministry of National Defense (MND) data, the PLA sent a total of 1,737
        aircraft in Taiwan’s ADIZ in 2022. This is a 79 percent increase from 972 incursions in 2021.
      </p>
      <p>
        ● Throughout 2022, the PLA also diversified the type of aircraft it sent into Taiwan’s ADIZ.
        Since September 2022, when the Taiwan MND began releasing information on UAV operations
        in the ADIZ, UAVs have made up around 10 percent of aircraft tracked.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the 20th Party Congress in 2022, Xi Jinping repeated the CCP’s longstanding public position
        that China seeks peaceful unification with Taiwan but would never renounce the use of force
        as an option. Additionally, the CCP amended its constitution to reaffirm that it will resolutely
        oppose and deter Taiwan independence. The circumstances under which the PRC has historically
        indicted it would consider the use of force has evolved over time. These circumstances have
        included the following:
      </p>
      <p>
        ● Formal declaration of Taiwan’s independence<br/>
        ● Undefined moves toward Taiwan independence<br/>
        ● Internal unrest in Taiwan<br/>
        ● Taiwan’s acquisition of nuclear weapons<br/>
        ● Indefinite delays in the resumption of cross-strait dialogue on unification<br/>
        ● Foreign military intervention in Taiwan’s internal affairs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tensions between the PRC and Taiwan increased in 2022, as the PRC intensified political and
        military pressure aimed at Taiwan. Following the U.S. Speaker of the House CODEL to Taiwan
        in August 2022, Beijing released a new Taiwan white paper, which was the third paper issued
        by Beijing since 1993. The content of the white paper appears consistent with familiar talking
        points from Beijing, albeit with a more pointed tone. It highlights that unification is
        foundational to the PRC’s “national rejuvenation,” Beijing’s preference for peaceful reunification
        under the “one country, two systems” framework, and a refusal to renounce the use of force
        to compel reunification, if needed. Unlike the previous Taiwan white paper (released in 2000),
        this iteration explicitly calls out Taiwan’s ruling Democratic People’s Party for “having
        adopted a separatist stance,” and features heavier criticism on “external interference” by
        singling out the United States. The paper further asserts that all U.S. “interference” in Taiwan
        is guided by a strategy to use Taiwan as a “pawn” in an effort to contain China.
      </p>
      <p>
        The PRC continues to suspend formal communications with Taiwan, which began in 2016, and
        remains steadfast that Taiwan must accept the PRC’s view of the “1992 Consensus” to restart
        such engagement. China’s leaders have directly equated the “1992 Consensus” to the PRC’s
        “One China principle,” which was reaffirmed by President Xi in a January 2019 address to
        “compatriots” in Taiwan.

      </p>

      <h2>CONSISTENT U.S. DEFENSE ENGAGEMENT WITH TAIWAN</h2>
      <p>
        In response to U.S. defense engagement with Taiwan, Beijing routinely accuses the United
        States of not abiding by its One China principle. U.S. defense engagements with Taiwan, as
        one element of the unofficial U.S.-Taiwan relationship, remain consistent with our one China
        policy – as guided by the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA), three U.S.-China Joint Communiques,
        and the Six Assurances. U.S. defense engagement with Taiwan has evolved over time in
        response to the PRC’s capacity and willingness to use military coercion against Taiwan.
        This evolution does not contradict publicly-stated U.S. policy, and it is in fact required
        by U.S. policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        The 1979 TRA states that the United States “will make available to Taiwan such defense
        articles and defense services in such quantity as may be necessary to enable Taiwan to
        maintain a sufficient self-defense capability.” In 1982, President Reagan clarified in
        an internal memo—which the United States made public in 2019—that the quantity and quality
        of U.S. defense assistance provided to Taiwan be “conditioned entirely on the threat posed
        by the PRC.” President Reagan further emphasized that this linkage is intended as a
        “permanent imperative” of foreign policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        The United States opposes unilateral changes to the cross-Strait status quo by either side;
        does not support Taiwan independence; and expects cross-Strait differences to be resolved
        by peaceful means. United States defense engagement with Taiwan’s will continue to
        bolster these positions and be conditioned entirely on the evolving threat posed by the PRC
        and the interests of the people of Taiwan, as enumerated in U.S. policy.
      </p>

      <h2>PLA COERCIVE AND RISKY OPERATIONAL BEHAVIOR</h2>
      <p>
        The PLA’s coercive and risky air and maritime activity, particularly in the East and South
        China Seas, continued throughout 2022 and into 2023. The PLA’s coercive and risky activities
        includes unsafe, unprofessional, and other behaviors that seek to impinge upon the ability
        of the United States and other nations to safely conduct operations where international law
        allows. The goal of the PLA’s behavior is to pressure the United States and other nations
        to reduce or cease lawful operations near areas Beijing claims territorial sovereignty.
      </p>
      <p>
        Examples of the PRC’s coercive and risky operational behavior against U.S. and Allied aircraft
        have included lasing (i.e., the use of military-grade lasers against a target), reckless
        maneuvers (i.e., maritime bow crossings and barrel rolls and acrobatics in close proximity to
        aircraft), close approaches in the air or at sea, high rates of closure (i.e., rapid approaches),
        discharging objects (i.e., chaff or flares) in front of, or in close proximity to, aircraft; and
        other actions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The PLA’s behavior contravenes flight safety protocols and the international maritime rules of
        the road; increases the risk of a major accident, incident, or crisis, including the potential
        for loss of life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the last 18 months, the PLA appears to have been engaged in a centralized, concerted
        campaign to perform these risky behaviors in order to coerce a change in lawful U.S. operational
        activity, and that of U.S. Allies and partners. Prior to the fall of 2021, the PLA routinely
        intercepted foreign air and maritime assets operating in the Indo-Pacific, but these earlier
        interactions rarely involved PLA employment of coercive and risky behavior. Between the fall
        of 2021 and fall of 2023, the United States has documented over 180 instances of PLA coercive
        and risky air intercepts against U.S. aircraft in the region – more in the past two years than
        in the previous decade. Over the same period, the PLA has conducted around 100 instances of
        coercive and risky operational behavior against U.S. Allies and partners, in an effort to deter
        both the United States and others from conducting lawful operations in the region. The PRC’s
        messaging regarding its forces’ operational behavior, such as claiming it is “justified to take
        forceful countermeasures” against activities that Beijing labels “provocative,” suggests
        centralized coordination, not the behavior of a few isolated PLA officers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some examples of the PRC’s coercive and risky behavior include the following:
      </p>
      <p>
        ● In February 2022, a Chinese naval ship directed a laser at an Australian P-8A Poseidon
        aircraft operating in Australia’s exclusive economic zone, endangering the health of
        Australian airmen.
      </p>
      <p>
        ● While flying a mission between April and May 2022, the Canadian CP-140 patrol aircraft were
        the subject of harassment by PLAAF fighter jets, which on several occasions, attempted to
        divert Canadian CP-140s. The PLAAF aircraft did this by conducting close approaches which
        forced the Canadian patrol craft to alter its flight path to avoid collision.
      </p>
      <p>
        ● During a routine May 2022 maritime surveillance flight by an Australian P-8A in the South
        China Sea, a Chinese J-16 conducted a dangerous intercept maneuver which posed a safety
        threat to the P-8A and its aircrew. The Australian government issued a press release on this
        event.
      </p>
      <p>
        ● In June 2022, a Chinese J-16 cut across the nose of another Australian P-8A Poseidon that
        was operating in international airspace over the South China Sea. The Chinese jet released
        a round of chaff, which was ingested into the Australian aircraft’s engine.
      </p>
      <p>
        ● In December 2022, a PLA J-11 fighter came within 20 feet of the nose of a U.S. military
        aircraft operating lawfully in international airspace over the South China Sea.
      </p>
      <p>
        ● In February 2023, the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs issued a statement concerning
        an incident with a Chinese Coast Guard vessel, operating under PLA overwatch, engaged in
        dangerous maneuvers against a Philippine Coast Guard vessel operating within Manila’s own
        EEZ, including by deploying a military-grade laser that temporarily blinded Filipino crew
        members.
      </p>
      <p>
        ● In May 2023, the DoD released cockpit video of a PLA J-16 “thumping” a U.S. RC-135 aircraft
        by forcing the U.S. RC-135 to fly directly behind it in its wake turbulence.
      </p>
      <p>
        ● Less than one week later, in June, the DoD released video of the PLA’s unprofessional
        reaction to the USS CHUNG HOON during a U.S.-Canada bilateral Taiwan Strait Transit.
      </p>

      <h2>PLA RESPONSE TO HIGH-PROFILE VISIT TO TAIWAN BY FOREIGN FIGURES</h2>
      <p>
        Throughout 2022, the PRC continued to respond to high-level foreign visits to Taiwan with
        low-level military drills near Taiwan, typically including Taiwan Strait centerline
        crossings, increased PLA Navy activity around Taiwan, and public statements condemning
        the visits.
      </p>
      <p>
        In stark contrast, the PLA responded in early August 2022 to the CODEL vist to Taiwan
        with significantly larger-scale military activities that included several unprecedented
        actions. The Eastern Theater Command conducted snap military drills that included PLA
        aviation flying more than 250 fighter aircraft into Taiwan’s self-declared ADIZ and 13 PLA
        Navy vessels operating around Taiwan. The PLARF fired multiple ballistic missiles into
        impacts zones in waters around Taiwan, including the first-seen instance of at least four
        missiles overflying Taiwan. These military drills also afforded the PLA an opportunity to
        train simulated joint blockade and simulated joint firepower strike operations.
      </p>

      <h2>PRC MILITARY COURSES OF ACTION AGAINST TAIWAN</h2>
      <p>
        Although Beijing reaffirms that “peaceful reunification” is its preferred course of action,
        the PRC continues to signal its willingness to use military force against Taiwan. The PLA has
        a range of options to coerce Taipei based on its increasing capabilities in multiple domains.
        The PRC could increasingly signal its readiness to use force or conduct punitive actions
        against Taiwan. The PLA could also conduct a range of cyberspace, blockade, and kinetic
        campaigns designed to force Taiwan to capitulate to unification or compel Taiwan’s leadership
        to the negotiation table on the PRC’s terms. In any case, the PRC would seek to deter potential
        U.S. intervention in any Taiwan contingency campaign. Failing that, the PRC would attempt
        to delay and defeat intervention in a limited war of short duration.In the event of a
        protracted conflict, the PLA might choose to escalate cyberspace, space, or nuclear activities
        in an attempt to end the conflict, or it might choose to fight to a stalemate and pursue
        a political settlement. The PLA could offer Xi the following military options against Taiwan,
        listed below individually or in combination, with varying degrees of feasibilities associated
        risk. The PRC’s perception of domestic and international receptivity to military action,
        the expected impact on its economy of resulting sanctions, political trends in Taiwan,
        and its level of confidence in the PLA’s capability to conduct a successful invasion of
        Taiwan will determine which military option the PRC chooses during crises. The PLA practiced
        elements of each of these military options during its August 2022 large-scale military
        exercise aimed at pressuring Taiwan, and again in April 2023 in response to Taiwan
        president Tsai Ing-wen’s transit of the United States.
      </p>
      <p>
        Air and Maritime Blockade. PLA writings describe a Joint Blockade Campaign in which the
        PRC would employ blockades of maritime and air traffic, including a cut-off of Taiwan’s
        vital imports, to force Taiwan’s capitulation. Large-scale missile strikes and possible
        seizures of Taiwan’s offshore islands would accompany a Joint Blockade Campaign in an
        attempt to compel Taiwan’s surrender, while at the same time, posturing air and naval
        forces to conduct weeks or months of blockade operations if necessary. The PRC likely
        would complement its air and maritime blockades with concurrent EW, network attacks,
        and IO to further isolate Taiwan’s authorities and populace and to control the
        international narrative of the conflict.
      </p>
      <p>
        Limited Force or Coercive Options. The PRC could use a variety of disruptive, punitive,
        or lethal military actions in a limited campaign against Taiwan, probably in conjunction
        with overt and clandestine economic and political activities supported by IO to shape
        perceptions or undercut the effectiveness or legitimacy of the Taiwan authorities. Such a
        campaign could include computer network or limited kinetic attacks against Taiwan’s political,
        military, and economic infrastructure to induce fear in Taiwan and degrade the Taiwan
        population’s confidence in their leaders. Similarly, PLA SOF could infiltrate Taiwan and
        conduct attacks against infrastructure or leadership targets.
      </p>
      <p>
        Air and Missile Campaign. The PRC could use precision missile and air strikes against key
        government and military targets, including Taiwan’s C2 facilities, air bases, and radar
        sites, in an attempt to degrade Taiwan’s defenses, neutralize Taiwan’s leadership, or
        undermine the public’s resolve to resist.
      </p>
      <p>
        Amphibious Invasion of Taiwan. PRC writings describe different operational concepts for
        an amphibious invasion of Taiwan. The most prominent of these, the Joint Island Landing
        Campaign, envisions a complex operation relying on coordinated, interlocking campaigns for
        EW, logistics, air, and naval support. The objectives are to break through or circumvent
        Taiwan’s shore defenses, establish a beachhead, build up combat power along Taiwan’s
        western coastline, and seize key targets or the entire island.
      </p>
      <p>
        The PLA continues to test new options to force unification. In October 2022, seven Chinese
        civilian car ferries, under CMM, participated in amphibious landing drills on Chinese beaches
        in the Taiwan Strait. In August 2022, in response to the U.S. Speaker of the House CODEL
        to Taiwan, the PLA conducted joint exercises focusing on establishing air, maritime, and
        information superiority. The exercise consisted of joint air and maritime activities to
        the north, southwest, and southeast of Taiwan, focused on establishing air dominance,
        according to Eastern media reporting.
      </p>
      <p>
        A large-scale amphibious invasion would be one of the most complicated and difficult
        military operations for the PLA, requiring air and maritime superiority, the rapid buildup
        and sustainment of supplies onshore, and uninterrupted support. It would likely strain the
        PRC’s armed forces and invite a strong international response. These factors, combined with
        inevitable force attrition, the complexity of urban warfare, and potential for an insurgency,
        make an amphibious invasion of Taiwan a significant political and military risk for Xi and
        the CCP, even assuming a successful landing and breakout past Taiwan beachhead defenses.
      </p>
      <p>
        Small Island Seizure. The PLA also is capable of attempting various amphibious operations
        short of a full-scale invasion of Taiwan. With few overt military preparations beyond routine
        training, the PRC could launch an invasion of small Taiwan-occupied islands in the SCS, such
        as Pratas or Itu Aba. A PLA invasion of a medium-sized, better-defended island, such as
        Matsu or Kinmen, is also within the PLA’s capabilities. Such an invasion would demonstrate
        military capability, political resolve, and achieve tangible territorial gain while
        simultaneously showing some measure of restraint.However, this kind of operation involves
        significant, and possibly prohibitive, political risk because it could galvanize pro-independence
        sentiment on Taiwan and generate powerful international opposition.

      <h2>CIVILIAN ROLL-ON/ROLL-OFF (RORO) SHIPS AND THEIR POTENTIAL USE IN A TAIWAN INVASION</h2>
      <p>
        The lack of significant PLA amphibious ship buildup does not independently reflect a PLA
        deficiency toward building a military option to take Taiwan by force, but rather, is consistent
        with the PRC’s exploratory approach to testing multi-dimensional Taiwan seizure concepts.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2015, China’s official media reported that all future builds of five categories of civilian
        vessels had to be built to “national defense requirements” including container ships, RORO
        ferries, multipurpose vessels, bulk carriers, and break bulk ships.
      </p>

        In 2019, images emerged on Chinese state television that at least one of its RORO ferries had
        been modified with a ramp to allow amphibious vehicles to disembark at sea suggesting these
        ferries could be used to deliver first echelon forces without requiring prior seizure of a
        pier. By demonstrating intent to use commercial ROROs during an amphibious invasion, the PLA
        is eroding the principle of distinction under the law of armed conflict and obscuring crucial
        lines between warships and non-warships, civilians and combatants, and civilian objects and
        military objectives.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a similar state media disclosure, images emerged in 2021 showing that China had modified a
        flat deck container vessel to function as a landing platform helicopter (LPH) or as an
        expeditionary transfer dock (ESD); such modification could serve as a mid-way refueling point
        for helicopters returning from delivering air assault forces to Taiwan or enable PLA helicopters
        to transport forward stocks of logistics ashore.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although China has not officially revealed the size of its civilian fleet or how it plans to
        use it during an invasion, 2019 information indicated the PLA have at least 63 civilian ROROs
        suitable for military operations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Subsequent information from one Chinese province indicates as many as 64 civilian ROROs would
        be made available to the PLA in wartime and that these platforms would be equipped with weapons
        as part of the mobilization process.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some public estimates suggest that China’s use of its dual-capable civilian fleet could provide
        it greater displacement tonnage than the sum of all of the U.S. Navy’s amphibious assault ships.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2022, the PLA significantly stepped up RORO training to supportChina’s military activities
        by more than doubling the number of ROROs used to support similar activity in the prior year.
        Although most of these events consisted of troop movements within or between theaters, several
        marked a continued maturation towards using ROROs and other civilian shipping to support PLA
        amphibious force employment against Taiwan. However, these events have not demonstrated the
        realism or requisitite tactical proficiency to engage in wartime operations. This includes the
        absence of opposed landing operations in unfavorable weather conditions and sea states. It also
        includes a lack of RORO training to operate in convoys, conduct rapid disembarkation, and the
        offload of PLA forces at sea while underway.
      </p>
      <p>
        ● Floating Causeway Improvement. During three events between May and July 2022, two
        Chinese civilian ROROs participated in docking evolutions with a new floating causeway
        system intended to allow ROROs to disembark forces onto a beach without seizing a port or
        being modified to discharge amphibious vehicles at sea. The causeway observed in 2022
        featured several improvements over the one used in 2021 to include having six uniform
        self-propelled sections extendable to an additional 200 meters. The causeway system seems
        to rely on a semi-submersible barge to stabilize the causeway, which may limit its utility
        for a cross strait invasion. However, PLA naval writings stress the importance of floating
        causeways, especially those with wave attenuation capabilities, as one solution to dealing
        with Taiwan ports that might be inaccessible for off-loading operations in wartime.
      </p>
      <p>
        ● Large-Volume Lift Exercise. From mid-July to mid-August, the PLA conducted large
        amphibious lift exercises along China’s Northern and Southern coast, using 12 civilian
        ships including eight large RORO ferries. The lift capacity, number of vessels stops, and
        the number of participating ground vehicles suggest this training could have simulated the
        movement of up to a full group army for the first time. The PLA also conducted a five-day
        loading/unloading exercise in September 2022 using six ROROs and three cargo ships to
        simulate the movement of a heavy combined arms brigade in a Taiwan invasion.
      </p>
      <p>
        ● Denial and Deception Training. In August 2022, a PLAA air defense brigade exercise
        attempted to obscure observation of its loading onto a RORO in the Bohai Gulf. A PLA video
        showed the brigade entering a dock-side building where it hid for an undetermined period
        of time before loading onto a RORO using a tarp that extended from the building to the ship,
        likely intended to limit observation of their loading activity.
      </p>
      <p>
        ● Austere Port Operations. In mid-August 2022, a single RORO supported the transport of
        roughly 40 vehicles from a portion of Dongshan Port that had little cargo handling
        infrastructure, no pier-side RORO ramp, and no tugboat support. This training suggests the
        PLA seeks the capability to operate from any intact pier, even ones without offloading
        infrastructure.
      </p>
      <p>
        ● RORO Participation in PLAN Amphibious Forces. From August 31st to September 2nd,
        2022, the PLA conducted its most complex use of civilian shipping for amphibious assault
        operation at Dacheng Bay and Honghai Bay in southern China. The exercise featured 10
        civilian ships – including RORO ferries and RORO vehicle carriers – operating alongside
        PLAN amphibious ships, including at least one Type-071 LPD. The operations at Dacheng
        Bay made use of the new six-segment floating causeway, supported by a San Hong Gong
        submersible floating barge, which docked with at least one RORO ferry. ROROs in both
        exercise area off-loaded forces at sea, suggesting stern ramp modifications allowing for
        at-sea disembarkation are becoming more commonplace within the RORO fleet. One combined-arms
        amphibious brigade and one combined-armed amphibious battalion were believed to have been
        delivered as part of this exercise.

        THE PLA’S CURRENT POSTURE FOR A TAIWAN CONFLICT
      </p>
      <p>
        PLAA. The PLAA has increased its posture in the Eastern Theater Command and along the
        Taiwan Strait, providing the PLAA with enhanced firepower, mobility, and rapid strike
        capabilities. Significant reorganizations and amphibious assault training in recent years
        likely indicate that the Taiwan contingency is a high priority for the Army. Major PLAA
        contributions to a Taiwan invasion scenario likely include extensive amphibious, army
        aviation, and air assault operations.
      </p>
      <p>
        The PLAA fields six amphibious combined arms brigades—four in the Eastern Theater Command
        (nearest Taiwan) and two in the Southern Theater Command. PLAA units continued amphibious
        assault training as a single service and with joint service counterparts in 2022. Training
        events refined the tactics of rapid loading, long-distance transport and beach assault under
        complicated sea situations, and logistic support capabilities. Press reports also claimed
        that the PLA extensively used sea, air, and ground UAS in support of the amphibious assault
        operation. PLAA amphibious brigades reportedly conduct realistic, large-scale amphibious
        operations that are almost certainly aimed at supporting a Taiwan invasion scenario.
      </p>
      <p>
        PLAN. The PLAN is improving its anti-air, anti-surface, and ASW capabilities, further
        developing an at-sea nuclear deterrence, and introducing new multi-mission platforms capable
        of conducting diverse missions during peace and war and has increased its posture surrounding
        Taiwan since August 2022.New attack submarines and modern surface combatants with anti-air
        capabilities and fourth-generation naval aircraft entering the force are designed to achieve
        maritime superiority within the FIC as well as to deter and counter any potential third-party
        intervention in a Taiwan conflict.
      </p>
      <p>
        The PRC’s amphibious fleet has in recent years focused on acquiring a modest number of oceangoing LPD and LHA ships. There is no indication the PRC is significantly expanding its number of
        tank landing ships (LSTs) and medium sized landing craft at this time. Although the PLAN has
        not invested in the large number of landing ships and medium landing craft that analysts
        believe the PLA would need for a large-scale assault on Taiwan, it is possible the PLA
        assesses it has sufficient amphibious capacity and has mitigated shortfalls through investment
        in other operational capabilities, such as civilian lift vessels and rotary-wing assets to
        address this gap. The PLA may also have confidence in the PRC’s shipbuilding industry’s massive
        capacity to produce the necessary ship-to-shore connectors relatively quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
        PLAAF. The PLAAF has maintained a ready force posture for a variety of capabilities necessary
        in a Taiwan contingency. It has acquired a large number of advanced aircraft capable of
        conducting operations against Taiwan without requiring refueling, providing it with a
        significant capability to conduct air and ground-attack operations. A number of long-range
        air defense systems provide a strong layer of defense against attacks on key military
        installations or population centers on China’s mainland. The PRC’s development of support
        aircraft provides the PLAAF with improved ISR capability to support PLA operations. The
        PLAAF also has improved refueling capabilities, expanding its ability to operate further
        from China and increasing its ability to threaten third party intervention. Throughout
        2022, Eastern Theater Command-based PLAAF units operated at higher levels than in previous
        years. Taiwan ADIZ incursions involved greater numbers of aircraft and were more frequent
        than in 2021, demonstrating the PLAAF’s improved ability to sustain pressure on Taiwan.
      </p>
      <p>
        PLARF. The PLARF is prepared to conduct missile attacks against high-value targets, including
        Taiwan’s C2 facilities, air bases, and radar sites, in an attempt to degrade Taiwan’s defenses,
        neutralize Taiwan’s leadership, or break the public’s will to fight. As of 2023, the PLARF is
        increasing its presence along the Taiwan Strait with new missile brigades, possibly indicating
        an increasing number of deployed missiles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Strategic Support Force (SSF). PLA doctrinal writings emphasize the importance of space and
        cyberspace domains in joint operations. PLA writings suggest that the SSF would be responsible
        for the use of EW and cyberspace operations during a Taiwan contingency, as one of the missions
        of the force is to seize and maintain information dominance. The SSF 311 Base would be
        responsible for political and psychological warfare, such as disseminating propaganda against
        Taiwan to influence public opinion and promote the PRC’s interests. The SSF would also play
        a strategic information and communications support role, centralizing technical intelligence
        collection and management and providing strategic intelligence support to theater commands
        involved in a Taiwan contingency. Following the U.S. Speaker of the House’s CODEL in August
        2022, Taiwan’s MND claimed that China launched widespread cyber-attacks against Taiwan.
      </p>
      <p>
        Joint Logistic Support Force (JLSF). The JLSF’s primary goal is to provide joint logistics
        support to the PLA’s strategic and campaign-level operations, such as a Taiwan contingency,
        by conducting C2 of joint logistics, delivering materiel, and overseeing various support
        mechanisms. The JLSF participates in joint, theater-level exercises, becoming most relevant
        when units operate far from their home garrisons and beyond their organic logistics
        capabilities.

        Annual Report to Congress: Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China
      </p>

      <h2>TAIWAN’S ABILITY TO DETER THE MAINLAND</h2>
      <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
      <p>● The PRC’s multi-decade military modernization effort continues to widen the capability gap compared to Taiwan’s military.</p>
      <p>● Geopolitical events in 2022 accelerated Taiwan’s development of new concepts and capabilities for asymmetric warfare to counter the PRC’s improving capabilities.</p>
      <p>
        Taiwan has positioned itself as “a beacon of democracy” to generate international support
        and expand regional security ties. Taiwan is taking steps to compensate for the growing
        disparity with the PLA, including building its war reserve stocks, growing its defense-industrial
        base, improving joint operations and crisis response capabilities, and strengthening its officer
        and noncommissioned officer corps. Taiwan’s Quadrennial Defense Review 2021 reflects adjustments
        to the military’s strategy for defending the island by placing emphasis on protecting its
        littorals and near-shore coastal areas in a multi-layered defense-in-depth. The modified
        strategy stresses enhanced asymmetric and joint capabilities, as well as suggesting greater
        reliance on Taiwan’s Air Force and Navy through multi-domain deterrence measures.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2022, Russia’s war on Ukraine and the PRC’s forceful response to then-U.S. Speaker of
        the House’s CODEL to Taiwan in August increased the urgency with which Taiwan is pursuing
        defense reforms. The PRC’s response to the then-U.S. House Speaker’s visit accelerated
        the PRC’s ongoing military and gray zone activity toward Taiwan. The PRC’s actions likely
        intended to establish a new status quo and to place greater operational demands on Taiwan’s
        military.
      </p>
      <p>
        Taiwan’s planned improvements only partially address its defense challenges, and a majority
        of Taiwan citizens believe that the then-Speaker’s visit and the PLA response were detrimental
        to Taiwan’s security.
      </p>
      <p>
        Taiwan’s armed forces are authorized to fill approximately 215,000 billets, including 188,000
        active-duty billets. As of 2021, the MND had accomplished its goal to fill 90 percent of the
        active duty billets (169,000) with volunteers. As Taiwan transitions to an all-volunteer force,
        the cost savings from manpower reductions provided some margin to improve individual pay and
        benefits, housing, and incentive pay. However, these savings have been insufficient to cover
        the full increase in manpower-related costs needed to attract and retain personnel under the
        new system. Taiwan also faces considerable equipment and readiness obstacles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reservists, conscripts, and civil defense volunteers support the volunteer active duty forces.
        Taiwan’s number of reserve personnel ranges from one to two million, while there are fewer
        than half a million conscripts. In 2021, Taiwan passed legislation to establish an organization
        to improve the mobilization of reserves and civilians to support military operations. In 2022,
        Taiwan implemented this legislation by establishing the All Out Defense Mobilization Agency,
        which coordinates a whole-of-society approach to support military operations and disaster
        prevention and response. In December 2022, Taiwan announced that it would extend the duration
        of mandatory military conscription service from four months to one year and double conscripts’
        monthly salary starting in 2024.
      </p>
      <p>
        Taiwan continues to increase its defense budget to support defense acquisitions and strengthen
        its forces against Chinese pressure. In 2020, the Tsai administration announced defense spending
        to be the highest level since 1990. In October 2022, Taiwan proposed total defense spending of
        about $19 billion for 2023, a 13.9 percent increase from 2022, which will represent about 2.4
        percent of Taiwan’s GDP. In January 2022, Taiwan approved an $8 billion multi-year supplemental
        defense budget to strengthen Taiwan’s air and sea combat capabilities. Over half of Taiwan’s
        supplemental defense spending will fund missile corvettes and anti-ship weapons, such as the
        Hsiung Feng missile system. Meanwhile, China’s official defense budget continues to grow to
        around $230 billion in 2022, about 12 times larger than Taiwan’s defense budget, with much of
        China’s defense budget focused on developing the capability to unify Taiwan with the PRC by
        force.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recognizing the growing disparity between their respective defense expenditures, Taiwan has
        stated that it is working to develop new cost effective concepts and capabilities for asymmetric
        warfare. Specific areas of emphasis in Taiwan’s strategy include offensive and defensive
        information and electronic warfare, high-speed stealth vessels, shore-based mobile missiles,
        rapid mining and minesweeping, unmanned aerial systems, and critical infrastructure protection.
        Taiwan has also dedicated significant defense spending toward its Harpoon Coastal Defense
        Systems, domestic submarine program, upgrading its existing F-16 fighters and producing
        the remaining three of a previously planned four transport docks.
