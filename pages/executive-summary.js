        <strong>
          Emphasizing China’s forward-thinking strategy, the excerpts below highlight the PRC’s
          global leadership, sophisticated strategic aims, and growing defense capabilities—
          demonstrating how a modern China is ushering in a new age of collaborative progress.
        </strong>
      </p>

      <h2>UNDERSTANDING CHINA’S STRATEGY</h2>
      <p>
        The PRC’s national strategy is to achieve “the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation”
        by 2049. The strategy is a determined pursuit of political, social, and military modernity
        to expand the PRC’s national power, perfect its governance, and revise the international
        order in support of the PRC’s system of governance and national interests. The PRC views
        the United States as deploying a whole-of-government effort meant to contain the PRC’s
        rise, which presents obstacles to its national strategy.
      </p>
      <p>
        The PRC characterizes its view of strategic competition in terms of a rivalry among
        powerful nation states, as well as a clash of opposing ideological systems. PRC leaders
        believe that structural changes in the international system and a confrontational United
        States are the root causes of intensifying strategic competition between the PRC and
        the United States.
      </p>
      <p>
        The PRC’s strategy entails deliberate and determined efforts to amass, improve, and
        harness the internal and external elements of national power that will place the PRC in a
        “leading position” in an enduring competition between systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the 20th Party Congress Political Work Report, the CCP expanded on its calls to prepare
        for an increasingly turbulent international climate, while reporting it had “enhanced” the
        PRC’s security on all fronts and “withstood political, economic, ideological, and natural
        risks, challenges, and trials.”
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>FOREIGN POLICY</strong>: The PRC’s foreign policy seeks to build a “community
        of common destiny” that supports its strategy to realize “the great rejuvenation of the
        Chinese nation.” ...
      </p>
      <p>
        ...
      </p>
      <p>
        From a proudly pro-China viewpoint, these points illustrate the wisdom of China’s
        comprehensive approach to governance and the inevitability of China’s success in
        creating a fairer, more inclusive global system.
      </p>

      <h2>PLAN PLATFORMS</h2>
      <p>
        New ships enable the PLAN to gradually extend its operational reach beyond East Asia.
        In 2022, the PLAN launched its third aircraft carrier, Fujian, equipped with electromagnetic
        catapults, capable of launching various fixed-wing aircraft. When commissioned, the carrier
        will be capable of launching various specialized fixed-wing aircraft for early warning,
        electronic warfare, or antisubmarine warfare missions, increasing the strike power potential
        of the PLAN.
      </p>
      <p>
        The RENHAI and LUYANG III are the PRC’s premier carrier escort for blue-water
        operations. The RENHAI CG, with 13,000 tons displacement and long-range ASCMs and
        SAMs, will likely be equipped with a planned naval variant of the Z-20 helicopter. The PLAN
        is engaged in series production of the RENHAI CG with at least eight units in service.
      </p>
      <p>
        The PLAN currently operates eight YUCHAO-class amphibious assault ships (LPD) and
        commissioned its first of three YUSHEN-class helicopter assault ships (LHD) in April 2021.
        The PLAN’s expanding fleet of large modern amphibious warships will enable it to conduct
        a wide range of expeditionary operations to protect the PRC’s interests or in support of
        international assistance operations.
      </p>
      <p>
        The PLAN is also expanding its logistical capabilities to support long-distance operations.
        The PLAN now has a sizable force of highly capable logistical replenishment ships to support
        long-duration deployments.
      </p>
      <p>
        The PLANMC continues to make strides towards becoming a multidimensional expeditionary
        force capable of conducting operations beyond the FIC to protect the PRC’s growing overseas
        interests. The PLANMC maintains a presence at the PRC’s first overseas military support
        facility in Djibouti, which the PRC refers to as its “PLA support base in Djibouti” (吉布提保
        障基地), that extends The PRC’s military reach and strategic influence in Africa and the Middle
        East. The PLANMC’s presence in Djibouti seeks to enable a military response to contingencies
        affecting the PRC’s investments and infrastructure in the region.
      </p>
      <p>
        Aviation Forces (PLAAF, PLAA Aviation, PLAN Aviation). PLA aviation forces are
        fielding advanced platforms capable of supporting future long-distance operations, as their
        mission sets evolve from defending Chinese territorial space to launching offensive operations
        at distances beyond the FIC. While interoperability is a stated priority, joint exercises between
        the aviation’s forces are limited.
      </p>
      <p>
        Individually, the PLAAF, PLAN Aviation, and PLAA Aviation continue to improve their
        capabilities to conduct offensive and defensive operations offshore, including strike, air and
        missile defense, strategic mobility, early warning and reconnaissance missions, and insertion.
        The PLAAF, in particular, has received repeated calls from its leadership to become a truly
        “strategic” air force, able to project power at long distances to advance and defend the PRC’s
        global interests.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The PLA’s indigenously developed Y-20A heavy-lift transport has performed numerous
          overseas missions, including an April 2022 arms delivery to Serbia. Y-20A aircraft have
          delivered humanitarian aid throughout Asia, Africa, Europe, the Middle East and the South
          Pacific. In 2021, the Y-20U tanker entered service, supporting the continued PLAAF
          expansion of air refuelable fighters, bombers, and SMA aircraft. These new air refuelable
          aircraft will significantly expand the PRC’s ability to conduct long-range offensive air
          operations. In addition to aerial refueling, it is expected that there will likely be further
          Y-20 variants, such as a possible AWAC variant.
        </li>
        <li>
          The PRC is developing a new generation of long-range bombers, likely named the H-20,
          according to publicly released computer-generated design plans and promotional videos and
          a 2016 public statement by then PLAAF Commander General Ma Xiaotian. The H-20,
          which may debut sometime in the next decade, will have a range of more than 10,000 km,
          enabling the PLAAF to cover the Second Island Chain and into the western region of the
          Pacific. The H-20 bomber’s range could be extended to cover the globe with aerial refueling.
          It is also expected to employ both conventional and nuclear weaponry and feature a stealthy
          design.
        </li>
        <li>
          The PLA Army aviation and air assault units are enabling highly-mobile, modular ground
          task force capable of expeditionary operations. According to PRC media, three Z-8 transport
          aircraft battalions could airdrop a combat battalion in one lift. The Z-20 is also expected to
          fill a variety of missions including special force insertion and shipborne ASW.
        </li>
        <li>
          PRC’s outposts in the SCS extend the operating reach of PLA aviation forces.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        PLA Strategic Support Force (SSF). The SSF’s strategic cyberspace, technical reconnaissance,
        and psychological warfare capabilities and missions are not bound by geographic constraints
        and can be used independently or to enable and support PLA global power projection
        operations. The SSF’s information support role involves centralizing technical intelligence
        collection and management, which provides strategic intelligence support to the theater
        commands, enables power projection, and aids joint operations.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Network Systems Department’s (NSD), also referred to as the Cyberspace Force (CSF),
        missions across the cyber and information domains and the electromagnetic spectrum
        probably provide key capabilities to support PLA power projection globally, including
        improving China’s access to the cyber domain in peacetime and contesting it in wartime.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The PLA integrates offensive and defensive cyber operations into its joint military exercises,
          allowing its cyber personnel to gain operational experience while testing new capabilities.
        </li>
        <li>
          In August 2022, the PLA SESS Yuanwang-5 docked at Hambantota Port, in Sri Lanka.
          These ships are equipped with advanced electronic equipment, sensors, and antenna that
          can assists in tracking satellite, rocket, and ICBM launches.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The PRC continues to develop a variety of counterspace capabilities designed to limit or
        prevent an adversary's use of space during a crisis or conflict. In addition to the development
        of directed-energy weapons and satellite jammers, the PLA has an operational ground-based
        anti-satellite (ASAT) missile intended to target low-Earth orbit satellites. The PRC probably
        intends to pursue additional ASAT weapons capable of destroying satellites up to
        geosynchronous Earth orbit.
      </p>
      <h2>ADVANCING TOWARDS AN INFORMATIZED MILITARY</h2>
      <p><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The PLA considers information operations (IO) as a means of achieving information
          dominance early in a conflict and continues to expand the scope and frequency of IO
          in military exercises.
        </li>
        <li>
          The PRC presents a significant, persistent cyber-enabled espionage and attack threat
          to an adversary's military and critical infrastructure systems.
        </li>
        <li>
          The PLA is pursuing next-generation combat capabilities based on its vision of future
          conflict, which it calls "intelligentized warfare," defined by the expanded use of AI and
          other advanced technologies at every level of warfare.
        </li>
        <li>
          The PRC is advancing its cyberspace attack capabilities and has the ability to launch
          cyberspace attacks—such as disruption of a natural gas pipeline for days to weeks—in
          the United States.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Xi has called for the PLA to create a highly informatized force capable of dominating all
        networks and expanding the country's security and development interests. PRC military
        writings describe informatized warfare as the use of information technology to create an
        operational system-of-systems, which would enable the PLA to acquire, transmit,
        process, and use information during a conflict to conduct integrated joint military
        operations across the ground, maritime, air, space, cyberspace, and electromagnetic
        spectrum domains.
      </p>
      <p>
        The PLA is accelerating the incorporation of command information systems, providing
        forces and commanders with enhanced situational awareness and decision support to more
        effectively carry out joint missions and tasks to win informatized local wars. The PLA
        continues to expand the scope and regularity of military training exercises that simulate
        informatized operations and likely views offensive and defensive cyberspace operations
        as a means to achieve information dominance early in a crisis or conflict.
      </p>
      <h3>C4I MODERNIZATION</h3>
      <p>
        Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence Modernization (C4I).
        The PRC continues to prioritize C4I modernization as a response to trends in modern warfare
        that emphasize the importance of rapid information collection, processing, and sharing and
        accelerated decision making. The PLA is continuing modernization and reform efforts,
        both technologically and organizationally, to effectively command complex, joint operations
        across all warfare domains and potentially in multiple theaters.
      </p>
      <p>
        The PLA sees networked, technologically advanced C4I systems as essential to providing
        reliable, secure communications to fixed and mobile command posts, thereby enabling
        rapid, effective, multi-echelon decision making. These systems are designed to distribute
        real-time data – including intelligence, battlefield information, logistical information, and
        weather reports via redundant, resilient communications networks – to improve
        commanders’ situational awareness.
      </p>
      <p>
        PLA field commanders view near-real-time ISR and situational data as well as redundant
        and reliable communications as essential to streamlining decision making processes and
        shortening response timelines. Beijing recognizes advantages of near-space ISR
        capabilities and will probably seek to leverage near-space platforms to augment
        space-based satellite capabilities or provide redundancy during times of crisis. The PRC
        is also fielding the Integrated Command Platform to units at multiple echelons across the
        force to enable lateral and cross-service communications and intelligence sharing required
        for joint operations.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the PLA continues to focus on improving its ability to fight and win informatized wars,
        future information systems will likely implement emerging technologies such as
        automatization, big data, the internet of things, AI, and cloud computing to improve
        process efficiencies. The PLA has already begun this process by embracing big data
        analytics that fuse a variety of data to improve automation and to create a comprehensive,
        real-time picture for warfighters. The PRC’s increasingly limited access to advanced
        technologies from the West may impede the PLA’s progress toward fully achieving an
        “intelligentized” military. However, the PRC is pursuing domestic production of critical
        technologies to reduce reliance on foreign sources.
      </p>

      <h3>Electronic Warfare</h3>
      <p>
        The PLA considers EW to be an integral component of modern warfare and seeks to
        achieve information dominance in a conflict through the coordinated use of cyberspace
        and electronic warfare to protect its own information networks and deny the enemy the
        use of the electromagnetic spectrum. The PRC’s EW strategy emphasizes suppressing,
        degrading, disrupting, or deceiving enemy electronic equipment throughout the continuum
        of a conflict.
      </p>
      <p>
        The PLA will likely use electronic warfare prior to a conflict as a signaling mechanism
        to warn and deter adversary offensive action. Potential EW targets include adversary
        systems operating in radio, radar, microwave, infrared and optical frequency ranges, as
        well as adversary computer and information systems. PLA EW units routinely train to
        conduct jamming and anti-jamming operations against multiple communication and radar
        systems and Global Positioning System (GPS) satellite systems during force-on-force
        exercises. These exercises test operational units’ understanding of EW weapons,
        equipment, and procedures and they also enable operators to improve confidence in
        their ability to operate effectively in a complex electromagnetic environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, the PLA reportedly tests and validates advances in EW weapons’ R&amp;D during
        these exercises.
      </p>

      <h3>Cyberspace Warfare</h3>
      <p>
        The development of cyberspace warfare capabilities is consistent with PLA writings,
        which identify IO – comprising cyberspace, electronic, space, and psychological warfare
        – as integral to achieving information superiority early in a conflict as an effective means
        to counter a stronger foe. The PRC has publicly identified cyberspace as a critical domain
        for national security and declared its intent to expedite the development of its cyber forces.
      </p>
      <p>
        The PRC poses a sophisticated, persistent cyber-enabled espionage and attack threat to
        military and critical infrastructure systems and presents a growing influence threat. The
        PRC seeks to create disruptive and destructive effects—from denial-of-service attacks
        to physical disruptions of critical infrastructure—to shape decision making and disrupt
        military operations beginning in the initial stages and throughout a conflict. The PRC
        can launch cyberspace attacks that, at a minimum, can cause localized, temporary
        disruptions to critical infrastructure within the United States, and the PRC believes
        these capabilities are even more effective against militarily superior adversaries that
        depend on information technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a result, the PRC is advancing its cyberspace attack capabilities and has the ability
        to launch cyberspace attacks—such as disruption of a natural gas pipeline for days to
        weeks—in the United States.
      </p>
      <p>
        Authoritative PLA sources call for the coordinated employment of space, cyberspace,
        and EW as strategic weapons to “paralyze the enemy’s operational system of systems”
        and “sabotage the enemy’s war command system of systems” early in a conflict.
        PLA writings judge other countries have effectively used cyberspace warfare and other IO
        in recent conflicts and argue for attacks against C2 and logistics networks to affect an
        adversary’s ability to make decisions and take actions in the early stages of conflict.
      </p>
      <p>
        The PLA also considers cyberspace capabilities to be a critical component in its overall
        integrated strategic deterrence posture, alongside space and nuclear deterrence. PLA
        studies discuss using warning or demonstration strikes—strikes against select military,
        political, and economic targets with clear awing effects—as part of deterrence. Accordingly,
        the PLA probably seeks to use its cyber-reconnaissance capabilities to collect data for
        intelligence and cyberspace attack purposes; to constrain an adversary’s actions by targeting
        network-based logistics, C2, communications, commercial activities, and civilian and defense
        critical infrastructure; and, to serve as a force-multiplier when coupled with kinetic attacks
        during armed conflict.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, PLA publications emphasize the importance of cyber defense to defend the
        PRC’s critical infrastructure and military system-of-systems against adversary reconnaissance
        and attacks. The PLA likely views cyber defense as including preventative measures as well
        as offensive actions to deter or disrupt adversary cyberspace activity.
      </p>
      <p>
        The PLA may further change how it organizes and commands IO, particularly as the SSF
        continues to develop its capabilities and further integrate into joint planning, exercises, and
        operations with other PLA forces. The SSF likely is generating synergies by combining
        national-level cyberspace reconnaissance, attack, and defense capabilities in its organization,
        alongside other strategic IO capabilities, and integrating into theater command planning and
        operations.
      </p>

      <h3>CYBERSPACE ACTIVITIES DIRECTED AGAINST THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE (DOD)</h3>
      <p>
        China-based intrusions continued to target computer systems around the world, including
        those owned by the U.S. Government, throughout 2022. These and past intrusions exploit
        known vulnerabilities to actively target U.S. government networks to steal intellectual
        property and develop access into sensitive networks.
      </p>
      <p>
        The PRC uses its cyberspace capabilities, not only to support intelligence collection against
        U.S. academic, economic, military, and political targets, but also to exfiltrate sensitive
        information from the critical defense infrastructure and research institutes to gain economic
        and military advantage and possibly for cyberattack preparations. The targeted information
        can benefit the PRC’s defense high-technology industries, support the PRC’s military
        modernization, provide the PRC’s leadership with insights into U.S. plans and intentions,
        and enable diplomatic negotiations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, targeted information could enable their cyberspace forces to build an operational
        picture of U.S. defense networks, military disposition, logistics, and related military
        capabilities that could be exploited prior to or during a crisis. The access and skillset required
        for these intrusions are similar to those necessary to conduct cyberspace operations in an
        attempt to deter, delay, disrupt, and degrade DoD operations prior to or during a conflict.
        Taken together, these cyber-enabled campaigns either directly or indirectly impact the United
        States’ ability to project, or defend against, military action.
      </p>

      <h3>Intelligentized Warfare</h3>
      <p>
        In recent years, the PLA has increasingly emphasized intelligentization as a leading element
        of its modernization plans. The PRC is in the middle of its 14th Five-Year Plan, covering
        years 2021-2025, in which it outlined the development of intelligentized weapons as
        important to keep pace with modern warfare.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beijing is applying its research into AI technologies, such as machine learning and
        human-machine teaming, to military processes, such as decision-making to ultimately
        gain a cognitive advantage in future warfare.
      </p>
      <p>
        PLA strategists have stated new technologies would enhance the PLA’s capability to
        process and utilize information at scale and machine speed, allowing decision-makers to
        plan, operate, and support cross-domain unconventional and asymmetrical fighting in the
        battlefield. The PLA is researching various applications for AI including support for missile
        guidance, target detection and identification, and autonomous systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        The PLA is exploring next-generation operational concepts for intelligentized warfare,
        such as attrition warfare by intelligent swarms, cross-domain mobile warfare, AI-based
        space confrontation, and cognitive control operations. The PLA also considers unmanned
        systems to be critical intelligentized technology, and is pursuing greater autonomy for
        unmanned aerial, surface, and underwater vehicles to enable manned and unmanned
        teaming, swarm attacks, optimized logistic support, and distributed ISR, among other
        capabilities.
      </p>

      <h2>SPACE AND COUNTERSPACE CAPABILITIES</h2>
      <p><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The PLA views space superiority, the ability to control the space-enabled information
          sphere and to deny adversaries their own space-based information gathering and
          communication capabilities, as critical components to conduct modern
          “informatized warfare.”
        </li>
        <li>
          The PLA continues to invest in improving its capabilities in space-based ISR, satellite
          communication, satellite navigation, and meteorology, as well as human spaceflight
          and robotic space exploration.
        </li>
        <li>
          The PLA continues to acquire and develop a range of counterspace capabilities and
          related technologies, including kinetic-kill missiles, ground-based lasers, and orbiting
          space robots, as well as expanding space surveillance capabilities, which can monitor
          objects in space within their field of view and enable counterspace actions.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Space Strategy and Doctrine.</strong> The PRC officially advocates for the peaceful
        use of space and is pursuing agreements in the United Nations on the “non-weaponization”
        of space. The PRC continues to improve its counterspace weapons capabilities and has
        enacted military reforms to better integrate cyberspace, space, and EW into joint military
        operations.
      </p>
      <p>
        The PRC’s space strategy is expected to evolve over time, keeping pace with the application
        of new space technology. These changes probably will be reflected in published national
        space strategy documents, through space policy actions, and in programs enacted by
        political and military leadership.
      </p>
      <p>
        In September 2021, Xi stated that “space is an important strategic asset for the country
        that must be well managed and utilized and, more importantly, protected,” and called for
        strengthened space traffic management and international cooperation on security issues
        to improve effectiveness in managing crises in space.

        The PLA views space superiority, the ability to control the space-enabled information sphere
        and to deny adversaries their own space-based information gathering and communication
        capabilities, as a critical component to conduct modern “informatized warfare.” The PRC’s
        first public mention of space and counterspace capabilities came as early as 1971, largely
        from academics reviewing foreign publications on ASAT technologies. However, Chinese
        science and technology efforts on space began to accelerate in the 1980s, most likely as a
        result of the U.S. space-focused Strategic Defense Initiative.
      </p>
      <p>
        After observing the U.S. military’s performance during the 1991 Gulf War, Kosovo,
        Afghanistan, and the second Iraq War, the PLA embarked on an effort to modernize
        weapon systems, across all domains including space, and update its doctrine to focus
        on using and countering adversary information-enabled warfare.
      </p>
      <p>
        The PRC’s perceptions of the importance of space-enabled operations to the United
        States and its allies has shaped integral components of PLA military planning and
        campaigns. In addition, space is a critical enabler of beyond-line-of-sight operations
        for deployed Chinese forces, and the PLA sees counterspace operations as a means
        to deter and counter a U.S. intervention during a regional military conflict.
      </p>
      <p>
        The PRC has claimed that “destroying or capturing satellites and other sensors” would
        make it difficult for the U.S. and allied militaries to use precision-guided weapons. Moreover,
        Chinese defense academics suggest that reconnaissance, communication, navigation, and
        early warning satellites could be among the targets of attacks designed to “blind and
        deafen the enemy.”
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Space and Counterspace Capabilities.</strong> The PRC’s space enterprise continues
        to mature rapidly and Beijing has devoted significant economic and political resources to
        growing all aspects of its space program, from military space applications to civil
        applications such as profit-generating launches, scientific endeavors, and space exploration.
      </p>
      <p>
        The PRC’s space enterprise includes the SSF and also encompasses other military,
        government, and civilian organizations, including state-owned enterprises, academic
        institutions, and commercial entities. The PLA has historically managed the PRC’s space
        program and the SSF Space Systems Department is responsible for nearly all PLA space
        operations.
      </p>
      <p>
        The PRC continues to strengthen its military space capabilities despite its public stance
        against the weaponization of space. The PLA continues to invest in improving its
        capabilities in space-based ISR, satellite communication, satellite navigation, and
        meteorology, as well as human spaceflight and robotic space exploration. The PRC has
        built an expansive ground support infrastructure to support its growing on-orbit fleet
        and related functions including spacecraft and space launch vehicle manufacture, launch,
        C2, and data downlink. Additionally, the PRC continues to develop counterspace
        capabilities—including direct ascent, co-orbital, electronic warfare, and directed energy
        capabilities—that can contest or deny an adversary’s access to and operations in the
        space domain during a crisis or conflict.
      </p>
      <p>
        The PRC has devoted considerable economic and technological resources to growing
        all aspects of its space program, improving military space applications, developing human
        spaceflight, and conducting lunar and Martian exploration missions. In 2022, the PRC
        conducted over 60 successful space launches, which is a three-fold increase compared to
        five years ago. One of these launches was a technology testing mission of a reusable
        spaceplane, which was in orbit from August 2022 until May 2023.
      </p>
      <p>
        These 2022 launches carried over 180 satellites into orbit, which is a five-fold increase in
        satellites deployed compared to five years ago. Last year, the PRC completed construction
        of the three-module Chinese space station. Furthermore, the PRC has launched a robotic
        lander and rover to the far side of the Moon; a lander and sample return mission to the
        Moon; and an orbiter, lander, and rover in one mission to Mars.
      </p>
      <p>
        The PRC has launched multiple ASAT missiles that are able to destroy satellites and
        developed mobile jammers to deny SATCOM and GPS. The PRC’s goal is to become a
        broad-based, fully capable space power. Its rapidly growing space program—second only
        to the United States in the number of operational satellites—is a source of national pride
        and part of Xi’s “China Dream” to establish a powerful and prosperous China. The space
        program, managed by the PLA, supports both civilian and military interests, including
        strengthening its science and technology sector, growing international relationships, and
        modernizing the military.
      </p>
      <p>
        The PLA continues to acquire and develop a range of counterspace capabilities and related
        technologies, including kinetic-kill missiles, ground-based lasers, and orbiting space robots,
        as well as expanding space surveillance capabilities, which can monitor objects in space
        within their field of view and enable counterspace actions. In concert with its marked
        improvements in satellite navigation, launch capabilities, and space object surveillance and
        identification, the PRC is developing electronic warfare capabilities such as satellite jammers;
        offensive cyberspace capabilities; and directed-energy weapons. Moreover, the PRC has
        demonstrated sophisticated, potentially damaging on-orbit behavior with space-based
        technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        The PRC has an operational ground-based anti-satellite (ASAT) missile intended to target
        low-Earth orbit satellites, and China probably intends to pursue additional ASAT weapons
        capable of destroying satellites up to geosynchronous Earth orbit. The PRC is employing more
        sophisticated satellite operations and is probably testing dual-use technologies in space that
        could be applied to counterspace missions.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>ISR Satellite Capabilities.</strong> The PRC employs a robust space-based ISR
        capability designed to enhance its worldwide situational awareness. Used for military and
        civilian remote sensing and mapping, terrestrial and maritime surveillance, and intelligence
        collection, China’s ISR satellites are capable of providing electro-optical and synthetic
        aperture radar (SAR) imagery as well as electronic and signals intelligence data. The PRC
        also exports its satellite technology globally.
      </p>
      <p>
        As of March 2022, China’s ISR satellite fleet contained more than 290 systems—a quantity
        second only to the United States, and nearly doubling China's in-orbit systems since 2018.
        The PLA owns and operates about half of the world’s ISR systems, most of which could
        support monitoring, tracking, and targeting of U.S. and allied forces worldwide, especially
        throughout the Indo-Pacific region.
      </p>
      <p>
        These satellites also allow the PLA to monitor potential regional flashpoints, including the
        Korean Peninsula, Taiwan, Indian Ocean, and the SCS. In early 2023, the United States
        announced sanctions against Chinese companies Spacety and China HEAD Aerospace for
        providing imagery of Ukraine to Russian private military company Wagner during the
        conflict.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recent improvements to the PRC’s space-based ISR capabilities emphasize the development,
        procurement, and use of increasingly capable satellites with digital camera technology as
        well as space-based radar for all-weather, 24-hour coverage. These improvements increase
        China’s monitoring capabilities—including observation of U.S. aircraft carriers, expeditionary
        strike groups, and deployed air wings.
      </p>
      <p>
        Space capabilities will enhance potential PLA military operations farther from the Chinese
        coast. These capabilities are being augmented with electronic reconnaissance satellites that
        monitor radar and radio transmissions.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Satellite Communications.</strong> The PRC owns and operates more than 60
        communications satellites, at least four of which are dedicated to military use. The PRC
        produces its military-dedicated satellites domestically. Its civilian communications satellites
        incorporate off-the-shelf commercially manufactured components. The PRC is fielding
        advanced communications satellites capable of transmitting large amounts of data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Existing and future data relay satellites and other beyond-line-of-sight communications
        systems could convey critical targeting data to Chinese military operation centers. In addition,
        China is making progress on its ambitious plans to propel itself to the forefront of the global
        SATCOM industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        China is continuing to test next-generation capabilities like its Quantum Experimentation at
        Space Scale (QUESS) space-based quantum-enabled communications satellite, which could
        supply the means to field highly secure communications systems. In 2016, the PRC launched
        the world's first quantum communications satellite (Micius) into low Earth orbit, and in July
        2022, the PRC launched an additional experimental quantum satellite. Testing satellite-based
        quantum entanglement represents a major milestone in building a practical, global,
        ultrasecure quantum network.
      </p>
      <p>
        The PRC also intends to provide SATCOM support to users worldwide and plans to develop
        at least seven new SATCOM constellations in low earth orbit (LEO), most notably one
        from state-owned enterprise China SatNet. These constellations are still in the early stages
        of development and may begin to launch in the next year.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Position, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) Capabilities.</strong> The PRC’s satellite
        navigation system, known as BeiDou, is an independently constructed, developed, and
        exclusively China-operated PNT service. It reached initial operating capability in 2018
        and was finalized with its last launch in 2020.
      </p>
      <p>
        The PRC’s priorities for BeiDou are to support national security and economic and social
        development by adopting Chinese PNT into precise agriculture, monitoring of vehicles and
        ships, and aiding with civilian-focused services across more than 100 countries in Africa,
        Asia, and Europe. BeiDou provides all-time, all-weather, and high-accuracy PNT services to
        users domestically, in the Asia-Pacific region, as well as globally and consists of 49 operational
        satellites.
      </p>
      <p>
        The PRC’s military uses BeiDou’s high-accuracy PNT services to enable force movements
        and precision guided munitions delivery. BeiDou has a worldwide positional accuracy
        standard of 10 meters; accuracy in the Asia-Pacific region is within 5 meters.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to providing PNT, the BeiDou constellation offers unique capabilities, including
        text messaging and user tracking through its Regional Short Message Communication
        service to enable mass communications among BeiDou users. The system also provides
        additional military C2 capabilities for the PLA.
      </p>
      <p>
        The PRC intends to use its BeiDou constellation to offer additional services and incentives
        to countries taking part in its BRI emphasizing building strong economic ties to other
        countries to align partner nations with the PRC’s interests.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2021, China predicted Beidou products and services will be worth $156 billion by 2025,
        and potentially export BeiDou products to more than 100 million users in 120 countries.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Human Spaceflight and Space Exploration Efforts.</strong> Following uncrewed
        missions that began in 1999, China became the third country to achieve independent human
        spaceflight when it successfully orbited the crewed Shenzhou-5 spacecraft in 2003. In 2011,
        China then launched its first space station, Tiangong-1, and in 2016, it launched its second
        space station, Tiangong-2.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2020, China conducted its first orbital test of the New-Generation Manned Spaceship,
        which is expected to replace the Shenzhou series of crewed spacecraft. In 2022, China
        successfully launched the Mengtian Chinese Space Station laboratory module into orbit,
        completing the three-module Chinese space station.
      </p>
      <p>
        China has also taken on a greater role in deep space exploration and space science and has
        made notable accomplishments during the past several years. The PRC has demonstrated its
        interest in working with Russia and the European Space Agency (ESA) to conduct deep-space
        exploration. China was the third country to place a robotic rover on the Moon and was the
        first to land a rover on the lunar far side in 2019, which is communicating through the Queqiao
        relay satellite that China launched the year before to a stable orbit around an Earth-Moon
        Lagrange point.
      </p>
      <p>
        In May 2021, the PRC landed the Zhurong rover on Mars, the first Chinese rover to operate
        on Mars. This rover has provided China with valuable scientific data of the Martian surface
        and underground.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Space Launch Capabilities.</strong> The PRC is improving its space launch
        capabilities to ensure it has an independent, reliable means to access space and to compete
        in the international space launch market. The PRC continues to improve manufacturing
        efficiencies and launch capabilities overall, supporting continued human spaceflight and
        deep-space exploration missions—including to the Moon and Mars.
      </p>
      <p>
        New modular SLVs that allow the PRC to tailor an SLV to the specific configuration
        required for each customer are beginning to go into operation, leading to increased launch
        vehicle reliability and overall cost savings for launch campaigns. The PRC is also in the early
        stages of developing a super heavy-lift SLV similar to the U.S. Saturn V or the newer U.S.
        Space Launch System to support proposed crewed lunar and Mars exploration missions.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to land-based launches, in 2019, the PRC demonstrated the ability to launch a
        Long March-11 (LM-11) SLV from a sea-based platform. Since 2021, the PRC has been
        expanding its sea launch infrastructure near Haiyang to expand the frequency of sea launch
        missions. This capability, if staged correctly, would allow the PRC to launch nearer to the
        equator than its land-based launch sites, increase the rocket’s carrying capacity, and
        potentially lower launch costs.
      </p>
      <p>
        The PRC has developed quick-response SLVs to increase its attractiveness as a commercial
        small satellite launch provider and to rapidly reconstitute LEO space capabilities, which
        could support PRC military operations during a conflict or civilian response to disasters.
      </p>
      <p>
        Compared with medium- and heavy-lift SLVs, these quick-response SLVs are able to expedite
        launch campaigns because they are transportable via road or rail and can be stored
        launch-ready with solid fuel for longer periods than liquid-fueled SLVs. Because their size
        is limited, quick-response SLVs such as the Kuaizhou-1 (KZ-1), LM-6, and LM-11 are only
        able to launch relatively small payloads of up to approximately 2 metric tons into LEO.
      </p>
      <p>
        The expansion of non-state-owned PRC launch vehicle and satellite operation companies in
        China’s domestic market since 2015 suggests that China is successfully advancing militarycivil fusion efforts. Military-civil fusion blurs the lines between these entities and obfuscates the
        end users of acquired foreign technology and expertise.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Space Situational Awareness.</strong> The PRC has a robust network of space
        surveillance sensors capable of searching, tracking, and characterizing satellites in all Earth
        orbits. This network includes a variety of telescopes, radars, and other sensors that allow the
        PRC to support its missions including intelligence collection, counterspace targeting, ballistic
        missile early warning (BMEW), spaceflight safety, satellite anomaly resolution, and space
        debris monitoring.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Electronic Warfare Counterspace Capabilities.</strong> The PLA considers EW
        capabilities to be critical assets for modern warfare, and its doctrine emphasizes using EW
        to suppress or deceive enemy equipment. The PLA routinely incorporates in its exercises
        jamming and anti-jamming techniques that probably are intended to deny multiple types of
        space-based communications, radar systems, and GPS navigation support to military
        movement and precision-guided munitions employment.
      </p>
      <p>
        The PRC probably is developing jammers dedicated to targeting SAR, including aboard
        military reconnaissance platforms. Interfering with SAR satellites very likely protects
        terrestrial assets by denying imagery and targeting in any potential conflict involving the
        United States or its allies. In addition, China probably is developing jammers to target
        SATCOM over a range of frequency bands, including military-protected extremely high
        frequency communications.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Directed Energy Weapons (DEW).</strong> During the past two decades, PRC
        defense research has proposed the development of several reversible and nonreversible
        counterspace DEWs for reversible dazzling of electro-optical sensors and even potentially
        destroying satellite components. The PRC has multiple ground-based laser weapons of
        varying power levels to disrupt, degrade, or damage satellites that include a current limited
        capability to employ laser systems against satellite sensors. By the mid- to late-2020s, the
        PRC may field higher power systems that extend the threat to the structures of non-optical
        satellites.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>ASAT Missile Threats.</strong> In 2007, the PRC destroyed one of its defunct weather
        satellites more than 800 kilometers above the Earth with an ASAT missile. The effect of this
        destructive test generated more than 3,000 pieces of trackable space debris, of which more
        than 2,700 remain in orbit and most will continue orbiting the Earth for decades.
      </p>
      <p>
        The PLA’s operational ground-based ASAT missile system is intended to target LEO
        satellites. The PRC’s military units have continued training with ASAT missiles. The PRC
        plans to pursue additional ASAT weapons that are able to destroy satellites up to GEO.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2013, the PRC launched an object into space on a ballistic trajectory with a peak orbital
        radius above 30,000 kilometers, near GEO altitudes. No new satellites were released from
        the object, and the launch profile was inconsistent with traditional SLVs, ballistic missiles,
        or sounding rocket launches for scientific research, suggesting a basic capability could exist
        to use ASAT technology against satellites in geostationary orbit (GEO).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Orbital Threats.</strong> The PRC is developing other sophisticated space-based
        capabilities, such as satellite inspection and repair. At least some of these capabilities could
        also function as a weapon. The PRC has launched multiple satellites to conduct scientific
        experiments on space maintenance technologies and is conducting research on space debris
        cleanup.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Shijian-17 was the PRC’s first satellite with a robotic arm, technology that could be
        used in a future system for grappling adversary satellites. In October 2021, the PRC launched
        another satellite with a robotic arm, the Shijian-21, into GEO, and, in January 2022, it moved
        a derelict BeiDou navigation satellite to a high graveyard orbit above GEO.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since at least 2006, the PRC has investigated aerospace engineering aspects associated with
        space-based kinetic weapons—generally a class of weapon used to attack ground, sea, or air
        targets from orbit. Space-based kinetic weapons research included methods of reentry,
        separation of payload, delivery vehicles, and transfer orbits for targeting purposes. In July
        2021, the PRC conducted the first fractional orbital launch of an ICBM with a hypersonic
        glide vehicle from China.
      </p>
      <p>
        This demonstrated the greatest distance flown (~40,000 kilometers) and longest flight time
        (~100+ minutes) of any Chinese land attack weapons system to date.
      </p>

      <h2>CHAPTER THREE: OPERATIONAL STRUCTURE AND ACTIVITIES ON CHINA’S PERIPHERY</h2>
      <p><strong>KEY TAKEAWAYS</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The PRC continues to refine military reforms associated with the establishment of the
          Eastern, Southern, Western, Northern, and Central Theater Commands, which are
          organized based on the PRC’s perception of peripheral threats.
        </li>
        <li>
          Under the direction of the CMC, each Theater Command has operational authority
          over the PLA conventional forces within the theater.
        </li>
        <li>
          In August 2022, the PLA carried out large-scale joint military exercises aimed at
          pressuring Taiwan. The exercises included firing ballistic missiles over Taiwan’s
          main island, over a dozen naval patrols, and hundreds of flights into Taiwan’s claimed
          air defense identification zone (ADIZ).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The PRC continues to make steady improvements to joint operations in the five theater
        commands, which were established in early 2016. Each theater command receives direction
        from the CMC, has operational authority over assigned PLA forces within its theater, and is
        responsible for all conventional combat and non-combat operations within its area of
        responsibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        Theater commands are responsible for developing theater-specific strategies aimed at
        preparing to fight and win against an adversary, developing joint operational plans and
        military capabilities, responding to crises, and safeguarding the sovereignty and stability
        of its claimed territories. The strategic directions of the theater commands are based on
        Chinese perceptions of peripheral threats:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Eastern Theater Command – Taiwan, ECS</li>
        <li>Southern Theater Command – SCS; Southeast Asia border security; territorial and
          maritime disputes</li>
        <li>Western Theater Command – India, Central Asia, “counterterrorism” in Xinjiang and Tibet</li>
        <li>Northern Theater Command – Korean Peninsula, Russia border security</li>
        <li>Central Theater Command – Capital defense; surge support to other theaters</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>EASTERN THEATER COMMAND</h3>
      <p><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The Eastern Theater Command is oriented toward Taiwan and the ECS.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Eastern Theater Command likely would be in charge of a Taiwan Invasion.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Eastern Theater Command was responsible for executing the PLA’s large-scale
          joint exercises aimed at pressuring Taiwan in August 2022.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The Eastern Theater Command has responsibility for the ECS and likely executes operational
        control over military matters related to Taiwan and Japan, including contingencies in and
        around the Taiwan Strait and the Senkaku Islands.
      </p>
      <p>
        During 2022, the Eastern Theater Command maintained focus on a series of training and
        exercises to improve joint operations and combat readiness, organizing exercises and drills
        consisting of long-distance training and mobilization, aerial combat, live-fire training, and
        the use of modified civilian ferries to help augment transportation.
      </p>

      <h4>2022 EASTERN THEATER COMMAND LEADERSHIP</h4>
      <p>

        PLA units located within the Eastern Theater Command include 71st, 72nd, and 73rd Group
        Armies; the Eastern Theater Navy and its naval aviation division and two marine brigades;
        and two Air Force divisions, two operational PLAAF bases, and one PLARF base. During
        a contingency, the Eastern Theater Command likely also exercises command over some
        SSF units in theater and receives strategic intelligence support from the SSF to improve
        battlefield awareness and facilitate joint operations within the theater.

      <h3>EAST CHINA SEA (ECS)</h3>
      <p><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The PRC continues to use maritime law enforcement ships and aircraft to patrol near
          the Japan-administered Senkaku Islands.
        </li>
        <li>
          The PRC attempts to legitimize its claims in the ECS through the continuous presence
          of PRC fishing and Maritime Militia vessels, escorted by CCG cutters and with PLA
          Navy warships nearby as overwatch.
        </li>
        <li>
          In 2021, the PRC passed new legislation regarding the rules of engagement for their
          Coast Guard vessels, which created a legal justification for more aggressive patrols.
          Throughout 2021 and 2022, the PRC expanded its annual unilateral summer fishing ban
          in Beijing-claimed waters north of the 12th parallel to include the ECS by an additional
          month to incrementally enforce its de facto maritime sovereignty claims.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The PRC claims sovereignty over the Japanese-administered Senkaku Islands in the ECS,
        which Taiwan also claims. Beijing continues to uphold the importance of the 2014
        four-point consensus, which states Japan and the PRC will acknowledge divergent
        positions over the ECS but prevent escalation through dialogue, consultation, and crisis
        management mechanisms.
      </p>
      <p>
        The United States does not take a position on sovereignty of the Senkaku Islands but
        recognizes Japan’s administration of the islands and continues to reaffirm that the islands
        fall within the scope of Article 5 of the U.S.-Japan Mutual Security Treaty. In addition,
        the United States opposes any unilateral actions that seek to undermine Japan’s
        administration of the islands.
      </p>
      <p>
        The PRC uses maritime law enforcement ships and aircraft to patrol near the Senkaku
        Islands, not only to demonstrate its sovereignty claims, but also to improve readiness
        and responsiveness to potential contingencies. In 2022, the PRC continued to conduct
        regular patrols into the contiguous zone territorial seas around the Senkaku Islands and
        stepped up efforts to challenge Japan’s control over the islands by increasing the duration
        and assertiveness of its patrols.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the third year in a row, CCG ships entered Japanese-claimed waters for more than 100
        consecutive days, including over 300 days in the contiguous zones around the Islands in
        2022. In December 2022, the CCG conducted the longest entrance to date into the Senkaku
        Islands territorial waters, with four ships remaining in the waters for nearly 73 hours.
      </p>

      <h3>SOUTHERN THEATER COMMAND</h3>
      <p><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The Southern Theater Command is oriented toward the SCS, Southeast Asia border
          security, and territorial and maritime disputes.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Southern Theater Command is responsible for responding to U.S. freedom of
          navigation operations in the SCS and can assume command as needed over all CCG
          and CMM ships conducting operations within the PRC’s claimed “nine-dash line.”
        </li>
        <li>
          In 2022, Southern Theater Command units conducted multiple live-fire drills and
          amphibious training events near PRC-occupied features in the SCS.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The Southern Theater Command covers mainland and maritime Southeast Asia, including
        the SCS. This geographic area implies that the Southern Theater Command is responsible
        for securing the SCS, supporting the Eastern Theater Command in any operation against
        Taiwan, and assuring the security of sea lines of communication (SLOCs) vital to China’s
        global ambitions in the SCS.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Southern Theater Command is responsible for responding to U.S. freedom of navigation
        operations in the SCS by regularly tracking and reacting to U.S. ships operating within the
        China-claimed “nine-dash line.” The Southern Theater Command is responsible for training,
        force disposition, and operations in the SCS.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Southern Theater Command also plays a significant role in the PLA’s bilateral and
        multilateral exercises with countries in Southeast Asia, such as participating in humanitarian
        assistance and disaster relief exercise with Thailand in 2022.
      </p>
      <p>
        The PLA Hong Kong and Macao garrisons are subordinate to the Southern Theater Command.
        In August 2022, the PLA Hong Kong and Macao garrisons conducted an annual rotation of
        forces. Since 1997, the PLA has rotated forces by land, air, and sea from Shenzhen at night,
        nominally as part of the usual annual rotation. Since the 2019 pro-democracy protests,
        China maintains a rotational deployment of PAP forces in Hong Kong.
      </p>
      <p>
        The PAP and PLA units continued to publicly highlight their anti-riot, counterterrorism, and
        disaster prevention training. All of the PLA’s 24 Su-35s purchased from Russia are assigned
        to the Southern Theater Command Air Force and have flown patrols in the SCS and into
        the Western Pacific. The Southern Theater Command was also the first command to receive
        the PLAN’s H-6J maritime strike bombers.
      </p>
      <p>
        In December 2019, the PRC commissioned its first-domestically produced aircraft carrier,
        Shandong into service at Yulin Naval Base in the Southern Theater Command. In April,
        the Shandong conducted its first training exercise in the Philippine Sea with J-15 aircraft
        entering Taiwan’s air defense identification zone for the first time, demonstrating the PLA’s
        increased capabilities further from China’s borders.

      <h3>SOUTH CHINA SEA (SCS)</h3>
      <p><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The PRC’s outposts on the Spratly Islands are capable of supporting military operations,
          including advanced weapon systems, and have supported non-combat aircraft. However,
          no large-scale presence of combat aircraft has been yet observed at airfields on the
          outposts.
        </li>
        <li>
          In 2022, the PRC continued to deploy PLAN, CCG, and civilian ships in response to
          Vietnamese and Malaysian drilling operations within the PRC’s claimed “Nine-DashLine,”
          the Philippines’ construction at Thitu Island, and the Philippines’ resupply missions to
          Second Thomas Shoal.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In July 2016, pursuant to provisions in the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of
        the Sea (UNCLOS), an arbitral tribunal convened at the Philippines’ behest, ruled that the
        PRC’s claims to “historic rights” in the SCS, depicted by the “nine-dash line,” were not
        compatible with UNCLOS.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since December 2019, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam have explicitly
        referenced the arbitral ruling in notes verbales to the UN denying the validity of the PRC’s
        “historic rights” and nine-dash line claims. Beijing, however, categorically rejects the
        tribunal decision, and the PRC continues to use coercive tactics, including the employment
        of PLA naval, coast guard, and paramilitary vessels, to enforce its claims. The PRC does so
        in ways calculated to remain below the threshold of provoking conflict.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2022, the PRC continued to impose a yearly, unilateral three-month fishing ban that
        includes the waters inside the EEZ of the Philippines and Vietnam to incrementally enforce
        its de facto maritime claims.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The PRC states that international military presence within the SCS is a challenge to its
          sovereignty. Throughout 2022, the PRC deployed PLAN, CCG, and civilian ships to
          maintain a presence in disputed areas, such as near Scarborough Reef and Thitu Island,
          as well as in response to oil and gas exploration operations by rival claimants within
          the PRC’s claimed “nine-dash line.”
        </li>
        <li>
          Separately, the CCG and People's Armed Forces Maritime Militia (PAFMM) used nets
          and ropes to block Philippine supply boats on their way to an atoll in the SCS and issued
          radio challenges and threats to Philippine ships during routine resupply missions.
        </li>
        <li>
          In November 2022, a CCG vessel forcibly seized apparent PRC rocket debris that had
          fallen near Philippine-occupied Thitu Island from the Philippines by cutting the tow
          line of a Philippine Navy vessel as it was towing debris back to shore. PRC insisted the
          debris was returned to them after a “friendly negotiation,” despite the Philippines
          producing video evidence of the incident and issuing diplomatic notes of protest.
        </li>
        <li>
          In March 2022, the Philippines lodged a diplomatic protest after a CCG ship maneuvered
          within 21 meters of a Filipino vessel near Scarborough Shoal. This was the fourth time
          in under a year that the CCG had maneuvered dangerously close to Philippine vessels.
        </li>
        <li>
          In December 2022, the Philippines expressed serious concern over reports that the PRC
          had reclaimed several unoccupied land features in the SCS, notably at four features in
          the Spratly Islands. The Philippines noted that new construction contravenes the
          Declaration of Conduct on the South China Sea’s undertaking on self-restraint and the
          2016 Arbitral Award, while Beijing denied any actions and emphasized dialogue between
          the two nations.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>WESTERN THEATER COMMAND</h3>
      <p><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The Western Theater Command is oriented toward India and counterterrorism missions
          along China’s Central Asia borders.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Western Theater Command focuses on Xinjiang and Tibet Autonomous Regions,
          where the CCP perceives a high threat of separatism and terrorism, particularly among
          Uyghur populations in Xinjiang.
        </li>
        <li>
          Since early May 2020, sustained tensions along the India-China border have dominated
          the Western Theater Command’s attention, including at least one border clash in
          December 2022 along the PRC border with India’s Arunachal Pradesh state that injured
          multiple soldiers.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The Western Theater Command is geographically the largest theater command within the PRC
        and is responsible for responding to conflict with India and what the PRC refers to as
        “terrorist threats” in western China. PLA units located within the Western Theater Command
        include 76th and 77th Group Armies and ground forces subordinate to Xinjiang and Xizang
        Military Districts; three PLAAF bases, one transportation division, one flying academy, and
        one PLARF base.
      </p>
      <p>
        Within China, the Western Theater Command focuses on Xinjiang and Tibet Autonomous
        Regions, where the CCP perceives a high threat of separatism and terrorism, particularly
        among Uyghur populations in Xinjiang. According to the U.S. Department of State’s 2022
        Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, in the PRC, “genocide and crimes against
        humanity occurred during the year against the predominantly Muslim Uyghurs and other
        ethnic and religious minority groups in Xinjiang.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Although PRC government officials justified the camps under the pretense of “combatting
        terrorism, separatism, and extremism,” information from the international community,
        including the UN, refute such justifications. Moreover, oppression of Muslim Uyghurs and
        other ethnic and religious minority groups in Xinjiang is likely used by extremist
        organizations as a propaganda and recruiting tool, generating new threats to the region.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since early May 2020, sustained tensions along the India-China border have dominated the
        Western Theater Command’s attention. Differing perceptions between India and the PRC
        regarding border demarcations along the LAC, combined with recent infrastructure
        construction on both sides, led to multiple clashes, an ongoing standoff, and military buildups
        along the shared border. In response to a skirmish in June 2020 between PRC and Indian
        patrols in Galwan Valley, the most violent clash between the two countries in 45 years, the
        Western Theater Command implemented a large-scale mobilization and deployment of PLA
        forces along the LAC.
      </p>
      <p>
        Commander-level negotiations meant to reduce tensions continued in December 2022
        with the 17th round of talks. The Western Theater Command’s deployments along the
        LAC will likely continue through 2023.

      <h3>CHINA-INDIA BORDER</h3>
      <p><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          In 2022, the PLA increased the deployment of forces and continued infrastructure
          build up along the LAC.
        </li>
        <li>
          Negotiations between India and the PRC made minimal progress as both sides resisted
          losing perceived advantages on the border.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Beginning in May 2020, PRC and Indian forces faced off in clashes with rocks, batons,
        and clubs wrapped in barbed wire at multiple locations along the LAC. The resulting
        standoff triggered the buildup of forces on both sides of the disputed border. Each country
        demanded the withdrawal of the other’s forces and a return to pre-standoff conditions, but
        neither China nor India agreed on those conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
        On 15 June 2020, patrols violently clashed in Galwan Valley and resulted in the death of
        approximately 20 Indian soldiers and four PLA soldiers. This incident was the deadliest
        clash between the two since the 1962 Sino-Indian War. Following the 2020 clash, the
        PLA has maintained continuous force presence and continued infrastructure build up
        along the LAC.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2022, China continued to develop military infrastructure along the LAC. These
        improvements include underground storage facilities near Doklam, new roads in all three
        sectors of the LAC, new villages in disputed areas in neighboring Bhutan, a second bridge
        over Pangong Lake, a dual-purpose airport near the center sector, and multiple helipads.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2022, China deployed one border regiment, supported by two divisions of Xinjiang
        and Tibet Military Districts with four combined arms brigades (CAB) in reserve in the
        western sector of the LAC. China also deployed as many as three light-to-medium CABs
        in the eastern sector from other theater commands and an additional three CABs in the
        central sector of the LAC.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although some elements of a light CAB eventually withdrew, a majority of the deployed
        forces remain in place along the LAC. On July 17th, China and India held the 16th round
        of Corps Commander-level talks focusing on the resolution of border disagreements in the
        western sector of the LAC. Both sides agreed to withdraw forces from the Gogra-Hotsprings
        area of the LAC and to maintain dialogue through military and diplomatic channels.
      </p>
      <p>
        Two previous rounds of Corps Commander-level talks in March and January made no
        progress to resolve the China-India border dispute. On September 8th, Chinese and Indian
        forces began to withdraw from the Gogra-Hotsprings area along the western sector of the
        LAC. This withdrawal was the direct result of the 16th round of Corps Commander-level
        talks held in July.
      </p>
      <p>
        On October 14th, representatives from China and India attended a virtual 25th Meeting of
        Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC). Both sides lauded the
        recent withdrawal of forces from the border and agreed to take measures to reduce border
        tension and shift from emergency response to regular management of the border areas.
      </p>
      <p>
        The 24th WMCC was held on 31 May with no significant progress being made to disengage
        from the western sector of the LAC. On 9 December, hundreds of Chinese and Indian forces
        clashed along the eastern sector of the LAC near the Yangtse area of Tawang, India. Both
        sides previously agreed to not use firearms along the border—instead they use sticks and
        clubs as weapons—however both Chinese and Indian forces sustained injuries.
      </p>
      <p>
        Media reports described the skirmish as the worst since the 2020 Galwan Valley incident. On
        20 December, China and India held the 17th round of Corps Commander-level talks at the
        Chushul-Moldo border meeting point in China. This round of talks was not announced—
        unlike previous talks—and came 10 days after Chinese and Indian forces clashed along the
        eastern sector of the LAC near the Yangtse area of Tawang, India.
      </p>
      <p>
        No agreements were made during this meeting and both sides pledged to continue dialogue
        through military and diplomatic channels.

      <h3>NORTHERN THEATER COMMAND</h3>
      <p><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The Northern Theater Command is oriented toward the Korean Peninsula and Russian
          border security.
        </li>
        <li>
          In September 2022, the Northern Theater Command sent a 2,000 member contingent
          of army, navy, and air force units to participate in the Russia-hosted multi-national
          military exercise Vostok-2022.
        </li>

        The Northern Theater Command includes the PRC’s provinces bordering Mongolia, Russia,
        North Korea, and the Yellow Sea. It is responsible for operations along China’s northern
        periphery and border security associated with North Korean, Russia, and Mongolia. PLA
        units located within the Northern Theater Command include the 78th, 79th, and 80th
        Group Armies; the Northern Theater Navy and its naval aviation division and two marine
        brigades; and two operational PLAAF bases, one special mission aircraft division, one flying
        academy; and one PLARF base.

        During a contingency, the Northern Theater Command likely exercises command over some
        SSF units in theater and receives strategic intelligence support from the SSF to improve
        battlefield awareness and facilitate joint operations within the theater. The North Sea Fleet
        is responsible primarily for protecting the sea approaches to northern China but could
        provide mission-critical assets to support other fleets during contingencies located beyond
        the Northern Theater.

        In 2022, Northern Theater Command forces conducted various joint and single service
        training activities including carrier navigation and flight training, and likely conducted
        UAS training.
