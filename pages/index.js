          <strong>COVID-19 mitigation measures and multiple outbreaks throughout 2022 probably did not
          significantly impact PLA combat readiness, judging from the PLA’s December 2022
          skirmishes with Indian forces near Tawang along the LAC and other deployments.</strong>{' '}
          While some non-combat programs like the PLA’s annual spring recruitment program were 
          delayed, the PLA’s mitigation efforts probably were successful in limiting COVID-19

          The PRC has stated its defense policy aims to safeguard its national sovereignty, security, 
          and development interests. CCP leaders view these interests as foundational to their 
          national strategy. The modernization of the armed forces is an indispensable element of 
          the Party’s national strategy to modernize the country. At the Fifth Plenum in October 2020, 
          the CCP declared the PRC’s ambitions for becoming a rich country are closely integrated with 
          its ambitions to develop a powerful military. The PRC’s defense policy and military strategy 
          primarily orients the PLA toward “safeguarding” its perceived “sovereignty and security” 
          interests in the region while countering the United States. At the same time, CCP leaders 
          increasingly cast the armed forces as a practical instrument to defend the PRC’s expanding 
          global interests and to advance its foreign policy goals within the framework of “Great 
          Power Diplomacy with Chinese Characteristics.”
        </p>

        <p>
          Xi’s work report to the 20th Party Congress in October 2022 said that the People’s Liberation 
          Army must move quicker with troop training and new strategies to reach its target of becoming 
          a world-class military. The PRC’s military strategy is based on “active defense,” a concept 
          that adopts the principles of strategic defense in combination with offensive action at the 
          operational and tactical levels. To adapt the PRC’s armed forces to long-term trends in global 
          military affairs and meet the country’s evolving national security needs, PRC leaders stress 
          the imperative of meeting key military transformation targets set for 2027 and 2035. These 
          milestones seek to align the PLA’s transformation with the PRC’s overall national modernization 
          so that by the end of 2049, the PRC will field a “world-class” military.
        </p>

        <h3>Strategic Assessment</h3>
        <p>
          A key driver of the PRC’s defense policy is how the CCP leaders perceive the relative threats 
          and opportunities facing the country’s comprehensive national development. During Chairman 
          Xi’s CCP centenary speech, he called for the full implementation of the Party’s idea of 
          strengthening the army in the new era. The last defense white paper, <em>China’s National 
          Defense in the New Era</em>, published in 2019, reaffirmed that China’s armed forces are 
          aligned with and contribute to the strategies of the CCP, stating that ongoing military 
          reforms “ensure absolute leadership of the CCP over the military.” According to the paper, 
          Beijing views the international environment as undergoing “profound changes unseen in a 
          century.” The CCP concludes that “international strategic competition is on the rise” and 
          expresses deep concerns at what it sees as growing sources of instability in the near-term. 
          Beijing offers no introspection on its role in stirring geopolitical tensions through its 
          economic practices, military activities and modernization, excessive maritime territorial 
          claims, assertive diplomacy, or efforts to revise aspects of global governance. Rather, the 
          PRC describes the international system as being “…undermined by growing hegemonism, power 
          politics, unilateralism and constant regional conflicts and wars.” Similarly, the PRC contends 
          that global military competition is intensifying and that “major countries” are adjusting 
          their security and military strategies, reorganizing their militaries, and are developing 
          new types of combat forces to “seize the strategic commanding heights in military competition.”
        </p>

        <h3>Defense Policy</h3>
        <p>
          The PRC’s stated defense policy is to “resolutely safeguard” its sovereignty, security, and 
          development interests, according to its 2019 defense white paper, which provides continuity 
          with past statements by PRC senior leaders and other official documents. Xi’s work report to 
          the 20th Party Congress reiterated this policy, saying that fast modernization of the PLA’s 
          organization, personnel, and military technology standards, under the absolute leadership of 
          the party, would be key not only to defending China’s sovereignty but also its security and 
          developmental interests. In practice, the PRC’s military power is increasingly a central 
          feature of the CCP’s regional and global ambitions. The 2019 defense white paper also 
          identifies the PRC’s national defense aims that support these interests, in likely order of 
          importance:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>to deter and resist aggression;</li>
          <li>to safeguard national political security, the people’s security, and social stability;</li>
          <li>to oppose and contain “Taiwan independence;”</li>
          <li>to crack down on proponents of separatist movements such as “Tibet independence” 
              and the creation of “East Turkistan;”</li>
          <li>to safeguard national sovereignty, unity, territorial integrity, and security;</li>
          <li>to safeguard the PRC’s maritime rights and interests;</li>
          <li>to safeguard the PRC’s security interests in outer space, the electromagnetic spectrum, 
              and cyberspace;</li>
          <li>to safeguard the PRC’s overseas interests; and</li>
          <li>to support the sustainable development of the country.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Key changes in defense policy for the “New Era” include efforts to improve coordination 
          across the party-state to leverage all organs of national power in a unified approach to 
          support the CCP’s ambitions of a global military capability. Unlike previous defense white 
          papers, <em>China’s National Defense in the New Era</em> explicitly stressed the PRC’s armed 
          forces’ alignment and support to the Party’s broader societal and foreign policy objectives. 
          For example, the white paper states that the PRC’s armed forces must be ready to “provide 
          strong strategic support for the realization of the Chinese Dream of national rejuvenation, 
          and to make new and greater contributions to the building of a shared future for mankind.” 
          Also notable is the explicit alignment between the PRC’s defense and foreign policies, 
          particularly in the armed forces’ role in protecting the PRC’s overseas interests and 
          furthering the CCP’s concept of “strategic partnerships” with other countries.
        </p>

        <h3>Military Strategic Guidelines (军事战略方针)</h3>
        <p>
          The Chairman of the CMC issues military strategic guidelines to the PLA that provide the 
          foundation of the PRC’s military strategy. The military strategic guidelines set the general 
          principles and concepts for the use of force in support of the CCP’s strategic objectives, 
          provide guidance on the threats and conditions the armed forces should be prepared to face, 
          and set priorities for planning, modernization, force structure, and readiness. The CCP 
          leadership issues new military strategic guidelines, or adjusts existing guidelines, whenever 
          they perceive it necessary to shift the PLA’s priorities based on the Party’s perceptions 
          of China’s security environment or changes in the character of warfare.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since 2019, trends indicate the PRC has reviewed and adjusted its military strategic 
          guidelines. In early 2019, PRC state media indicated that Beijing held senior-level meetings 
          to “establish the military strategy of the ‘New Era.’” The PRC’s 2019 defense white paper 
          states that the PLA is implementing guidelines for the “New Era” that “…actively adapt to 
          the new landscape of strategic competition, the new demands of national security, and new 
          developments in modern warfare…” PRC official media in the latter half of 2019 echoed these 
          themes and described the guidelines as constituting a notable change. The PRC’s defense 
          white paper may reflect changes in the guidelines given its emphasis on the intensification 
          of global military competition, the increase in the pace of technological change, and the 
          military modernization themes introduced by General Secretary Xi at the 19th Party Congress. 
          Documents released following the Fifth Plenum of the 19th Central Committee in October 2020 
          hailed progress in the “comprehensive and in-depth” implementation of the “New Era military 
          strategic guidelines.”
        </p>

        <p>
          These developments are notable because the CCP leadership has issued new military strategic 
          guidelines or adjusted its guidelines only a few times since the end of the Cold War. In 
          1993, the CMC under Jiang Zemin directed the PLA to prepare to win “local wars” under 
          “high-tech conditions” after observing U.S. military operations in the Gulf War. In 2004, 
          the CMC under Hu Jintao ordered the military to focus on winning “local wars under 
          informationized conditions.” In 2014, the CMC placed greater focus on conflicts in the 
          maritime domain and fighting “informatized local wars.”
        </p>

        <h3>Military Strategy — Active Defense</h3>
        <p>
          The PRC’s military strategy is based on what it describes as “active defense,” a concept 
          that adopts the principles of strategic defense in combination with offensive action at the 
          operational and tactical levels. Active defense is neither a purely defensive strategy nor 
          limited to territorial defense. Active defense encompasses offensive and preemptive aspects. 
          It can apply to the PRC acting externally to defend its interests. Active defense is rooted 
          in the principle of avoiding initiating armed conflict but responding forcefully if 
          challenged. The PRC’s 2019 defense white paper reaffirmed active defense as the basis for 
          its military strategy. Minister of National Defense General Wei Fenghe reiterated this 
          principle of active defense in his speech at the Ninth Beijing Xiangshan Forum in 2019, 
          stating that the PRC “will not attack unless we are attacked, but will surely counterattack 
          if attacked.”
        </p>

        <p>
          First adopted by the CCP in the 1930s, active defense has served as the basis for the PRC’s 
          military strategy since its founding in 1949. Although the PRC has adjusted and tailored the 
          specifics of active defense over time based on changes in strategic circumstances, its general 
          principles have remained consistent. Contemporary PRC writings describe the tenets of active 
          defense as:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Adhere to a position of self-defense and stay with striking back.</strong> This 
            describes the basic principle for the use of military force under active defense. The 
            PRC’s 2019 defense white paper describes this principle as, “We will not attack unless 
            we are attacked, but we will surely counterattack if attacked.” Active defense may 
            entail defensive counterattacks in response to an attack or preemptively striking an 
            adversary that the PRC judges is preparing to attack.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Combine strategic defense with operational and tactical offense.</strong> This 
            aspect offers two approaches to warfare influenced by Mao Zedong’s notion of using 
            defense and offense in turns. First, active defense may involve offensive campaigns, 
            operations, and tactical actions in support of the strategic defense. These may occur 
            rapidly and along “external lines.” Second, it uses strategic defense to weaken the 
            enemy and set the conditions to transition into strategic offense in order to secure 
            victory. Strategic defense is not equivalent to deterrence but includes deterrence. 
            Strategic defense also includes actions taken after deterrence has failed, such as 
            conducting conventional strikes against an adversary.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Taking the operational initiative.</strong> This aspect emphasizes the effective 
            use of offensives at the operational and tactical levels, avoiding enemy strengths, 
            and concentrating on building asymmetric advantages against enemy weaknesses to 
            “change what is inferior into what is superior.”
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Strive for the best possibilities.</strong> This calls for thorough peacetime 
            military preparations and planning based on fighting the most challenging threat 
            under the most complicated circumstances “in order to get the best results.” This 
            aspect stresses the importance of setting conditions in advance and suggests it is 
            preferable to be prepared and not fight, than to fight unprepared.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The dialectical unity of restraining war and winning war.</strong> This tenet 
            seeks to resolve the dilemma that using too little force may protract a war instead of 
            stopping it while the unconstrained use of force may worsen a war and make it harder 
            to stop. Calling for the “effective restraint of warfare,” this tenet seeks to avoid 
            war first through sufficient military preparations and powerful conventional and 
            strategic forces that act in concert with political and diplomatic efforts to “subdue 
            the enemy’s troops without fighting.” If war is unavoidable, however, this aspect 
            calls for restraining war by taking the “opening move” and “using war to stop war.”
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Soldiers and the people are the source of victory.</strong> This integrates the 
            concept of active defense with the concept of “people’s war.” People’s war comprises 
            subordinate military strategies, “guerrilla war” and “protracted war,” that Mao saw 
            as a means to harness the capacity of China’s populace as a source of political 
            legitimacy and mobilization to generate military power. Contemporary PRC writings 
            link “people’s war” to national mobilization and participation in wartime as a 
            whole-of-nation concept of warfare.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <strong>Military Missions and Tasks.</strong> The CMC directs the PLA to be ready and able 
          to perform specific missions and tasks to support the Party’s strategy and defend the 
          PRC’s sovereignty, security, and development interests. The PLA’s missions and tasks in 
          the “New Era” include safeguarding China’s territorial sovereignty and maritime rights 
          and interests, maintaining combat readiness, conducting military training under real 
          combat conditions, safeguarding China’s nuclear weapons and its interests in the space 
          and cyberspace domains, countering terrorism and maintaining stability, protecting the 
          PRC’s overseas interests, and participating in emergency response and disaster relief.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Modernization Objectives and Targets.</strong> In his speech at the 20th Party Congress, 
          Xi detailed PLA goals of enhancing party loyalty in the military, while simultaneously 
          strengthening the military through reform, science and technology, personnel training, 
          mechanization, informatization, and modernized military strategies.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 2020, the PLA added a new milestone for modernization in 2027, to accelerate the 
          integrated development of mechanization, informatization, and intelligentization of 
          the PRC’s armed forces, which if realized could give the PLA capabilities to be a more 
          credible military tool for the CCP’s Taiwan unification efforts. The PLA’s 2027 
          modernization goal aligns with the 100th anniversary of the PLA’s founding. During his 
          October 2022 speech at the opening ceremony of the 20th Party Congress, Xi said that 
          China intends to complete the plan to modernize the PLA by 2027. In a March 2021 speech, 
          Xi detailed that the 2027 modernization goal is the first step in a broader modernization 
          effort. PLA writings note the “three-step” modernization plan connects “near-, medium-, 
          and long-term goals in 2027, 2035, and 2049” respectively.
        </p>

        <p>
          The PRC’s goals for modernizing its armed forces in the “New Era” are as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>By 2027:</strong> “Accelerate the integrated development of mechanization, 
            informatization, and intelligentization,” while boosting the speed of modernization 
            in military theories, organizations, personnel, and weapons and equipment.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>By 2035:</strong> “To comprehensively advance the modernization of military 
            theory, organizational structure, military personnel, and weaponry and equipment in 
            step with the modernization of the country and basically complete the modernization 
            of national defense and the military…”
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>By 2049:</strong> “To fully transform the people’s armed forces into world-class 
            forces.”
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The 5th Plenum communique holds that the 2027 goal means that the Chinese military should 
          comprehensively push forward the modernization of military theories, military organizational 
          form, military personnel, and weapons and equipment. PRC media, citing a military source, 
          connected the PLA’s 2027 goals to developing the capabilities to counter the U.S. military 
          in the Indo-Pacific region, and compel Taiwan’s leadership to the negotiation table on the 
          PRC’s terms.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Military Ambitions.</strong> The CCP has not defined what it means by its ambition to 
          have a “world-class” military by the end of 2049. Within the context of China’s national 
          strategy, however, it is likely that the PRC will seek to develop a military by mid-century 
          that is equal to—or, in some cases, superior to—the U.S. military, and that of any other 
          great power that Beijing views as a threat to its sovereignty, security, and development 
          interests. Given the far-reaching ambitions the CCP has for a rejuvenated China, it is 
          unlikely that the Party would aim for an end state in which the PRC would remain in a 
          position of military inferiority vis-à-vis the United States or any other potential rival. 
          However, this does not mean that the PRC will aim for the PLA to mirror the U.S. military 
          in terms of capacity, capability, or readiness. The PRC will likely seek to develop its 
          “world-class” military in a manner that it believes best suits the needs of its armed 
          forces to defend and advance the country’s interests and how the PLA—guided by the Party—
          adapts to the changing character of warfare.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Way of War.</strong> The PLA increasingly views warfare as a confrontation between 
          opposing operational systems, rather than a war of annihilation between opposing mechanized 
          military forces. Following this logic, PLA writings refer to <em>systems destruction warfare 
          (体系破击战)</em> as the next way of war, transforming from mechanized warfare to an 
          informatized and intelligentized style warfare. Although not a new PLA approach, systems 
          destruction warfare likely continues to be the principal theory guiding its way of war.
        </p>

        <p>
          In November 2020, the CMC announced that it had issued the “Chinese People's Liberation Army 
          Joint Operations Outline (Trial).” The Outline establishes a system for the PLA’s joint 
          operations and focuses on clarifying basic issues regarding the organization and 
          implementation of joint operations, command rights and responsibilities, and the principles, 
          requirements, and procedures for joint operations, combat support, national defense 
          mobilization, and political work. According to PLA writings, the Outline describes how the 
          future combat style of the PLA will be integrated joint operations under the unified command 
          of a joint operations command system. PLA writers emphasized that winning future wars would 
          require a high degree of joint integration of various combat forces and combat elements 
          from across the PLA services and other arms and across all domains, with jointness 
          deepened at the operational and tactical levels. PLA writings highlight the multi-domain 
          component of integrated joint operations and the need to coordinate the development of 
          “mechanization, informatization, and intelligentization integration.” The PLA’s 
          “operational regulations” were last updated in 1999 and PLA leaders and PLA-affiliated 
          academics have pointed to the lack of updated doctrine, which is out of step with the 
          2015-era structural command and organizational reforms, and an obstacle to advancing the 
          next steps in building a unified joint PLA.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since the CMC issued the Outline, the PLA has launched a force-wide effort to study and 
          implement it, including through joint operations undertaken during exercises. The PLA is 
          working to turn the Outline’s vision of joint operations into reality by breaking down 
          institutional barriers and standardizing command systems in practice. Along the way, the 
          PLA seeks to identify shortcomings, develop solutions, and facilitate the adoption of 
          modern operational concepts.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Core Operational Concept.</strong> In 2021, the PLA began discussing a new 
          “core operational concept,” called “Multi-Domain Precision Warfare (多域精确战)” (MDPW). 
          MDPW is intended to leverage a C4ISR network that incorporates advances in big data and 
          artificial intelligence, what the PLA calls the “network information system-of-systems,” 
          to rapidly identify key vulnerabilities in the U.S. operational system and then combine 
          joint forces across domains to launch precision strikes against those vulnerabilities. 
          MDPW is meant to sit atop an “operational conceptual system-of-systems,” suggesting the 
          PLA will develop additional subordinate operational concepts and use simulations, war 
          games, and exercises to test, evaluate, and improve these future-oriented operational 
          concepts. The timing of MDPW’s appearance vis-à-vis China’s updated doctrine and military 
          strategic guidelines suggests that MDPW serves as a connection between them, likely 
          amplifying themes and guidance in both while focusing on the contours of what the PLA must 
          be able to do to win future wars.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Joint Firepower Strike.</strong> PLA writings have long emphasized the importance of 
          joint firepower strikes as a component of large-scale operations. Joint firepower strikes 
          include multiple services combining to utilize their firepower capabilities to create 
          substantial effect and have been explicitly tied to a Taiwan invasion in PLA writings. During 
          the August 2022 Congressional Delegation (CODEL) visit to Taiwan, the PLA Rocket Force 
          fired multiple ballistic missiles into impact zones in waters around Taiwan; this included 
          at least four missiles that overflew Taiwan, which was unprecedented. The military drills 
          afforded the PLA an opportunity to train simulated joint firepower strike operations.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Readiness.</strong> Alongside modernizing the PLA’s capabilities and organizational 
          reform, PRC’s leaders have identified enhancing the combat readiness of the armed forces 
          as an important element in developing the PRC’s military strength. In recent years, Xi 
          and senior military leaders have continued to emphasize the need to build the PLA’s combat 
          readiness so it can “fight and win wars.” This emphasis has not only entailed the PLA 
          conducting more training but making its training more rigorous and realistic as well as 
          addressing issues in the PLA’s training and education systems relating to conducting complex 
          joint operations and adapting to other aspects of modern warfare. It probably has also led 
          to a standardization of a combat readiness system across the PLA to enable the PRC to 
          quickly transition to a wartime footing.
        </p>

        <p>
          Along with the CCP leadership’s focus on improving the PLA’s combat readiness, in recent 
          years PLA media outlets have noted shortcomings in the military’s training and education 
          systems that reportedly left some commanders—particularly at the operational level—
          inadequately prepared for modern warfare. In response to perceived personnel deficiencies 
          within the PLA, Xi approved and issued a new series of regulations in July 2022 regarding 
          the management of PLA soldiers seeking to improve recruiting, training, promotions, 
          benefits, and demobilization efforts for NCOs. In recent years, PLA media outlets have 
          identified the need for the military to address the “Five Incapables” problem: that some 
          commanders cannot (1) judge situations, (2) understand higher authorities’ intentions, 
          (3) make operational decisions, (4) deploy forces, and (5) manage unexpected situations.
          Although PLA writings do not specify how widespread the “Five Incapables” are, PLA media 
          outlets have consistently raised them. One outside expert has noted this may indicate the 
          PLA lacks confidence in its proficiency to execute its own operational concepts. 
          Additionally, senior Party and PLA leaders are keenly aware that the military has not 
          experienced combat in decades nor fought with its current suite of capabilities and 
          organizational structures. PLA leaders and state media frequently call on the force to 
          remedy the “peacetime disease” that manifests in the form of what it characterizes as 
          lax training attitudes and practices that are viewed as hindering combat readiness.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>COVID-19 mitigation measures and multiple outbreaks throughout 2022 probably did not
          significantly undermine PLA combat readiness, judging from the PLA’s December 2022
          skirmishes with Indian forces near Tawang along the LAC, and other deployments.</strong> 
          Although some non-combat programs like the PLA’s annual spring recruitment program were 
          delayed, the PLA’s mitigation efforts probably were successful in limiting COVID-19 
          outbreaks within China’s military.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Anti-Corruption Campaign.</strong> Anticorruption investigations in the PLA are a 
          component of a Party-wide effort that General Secretary Xi strengthened and accelerated 
          shortly after taking office. The stated goal of these campaigns is to safeguard the 
          legitimacy of the CCP, root out corruption, improve governance, and centralize Xi and the 
          Party’s authority. Military discipline inspectors led by the CMC Discipline Inspection 
          Commission have targeted individual power networks and occupational specialties historically 
          prone to corruption, such as officers connected to disgraced former CMC Vice Chairmen Xu 
          Caihou and Guo Boxiong, and former Chief of Joint Staff General Fang Fenghui. In 2022, 
          General Secretary Xi delivered a speech to the CCP Central Commission for Discipline 
          Inspection in which he stated that although serious potential dangers of corruption within 
          the Party and the military have been rooted out, the fight against corruption is still raging 
          in the PRC. In mid-2023, PRC media announced that PLA Rocket Force leadership was being 
          replaced and the PLA launched an inquiry into corruption linked to the procurement of 
          military equipment, indicating that the PLA’s anti-corruption campaign remains incomplete.
          Emblematic of Xi’s sustained focus on anti-corruption efforts in 2022, PRC authorities 
          continued frequent arrests of high-ranking officials and business elites for allegations 
          of taking bribes and abusing power, especially in the financial sector. In November 2022 
          alone, PRC authorities arrested the Vice Governor of the People’s Bank of China and former 
          CEO of a major PRC telecommunications firm as a result of investigations by CCP anti-corruption 
          bodies.

          <strong>Effects of COVID-19 on PLA Modernization and Reform Goals.</strong> In 2022, the 
          COVID-19 pandemic likely had little effect on the PLA’s modernization and reform goals. 
          At the 20th Party Congress in October, Xi continued to emphasize promoting the modernization 
          of China’s national defense and armed forces. A few months later, in his annual new year's 
          address, Xi highlighted military and strategic achievements from 2022 including the PLA’s 
          95th anniversary, the launching of the PLAN’s third aircraft carrier, and the completion 
          of China's space station. In 2022, the PLA continued to play a role in COVID-19 response 
          activity, such as mobilizing approximately 2,000 medical personnel to Shanghai during an 
          outbreak in April. The PRC’s recent Government Work Report referenced PLA activities through 
          the last year, including COVID-19 response that boosted China’s national defense mobilization 
          capability.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Party-Army Relations.</strong> The PLA is the principal armed wing of the CCP and, 
          as a Party-army, does not directly serve the state but rather is under the direct control 
          of the Party. The CCP CMC, currently chaired by Xi, is the highest military decision-making 
          body in the PRC. As a Party-army, the PLA is a political actor. As a constituency within 
          the Party, it participates in the PRC’s political and governance systems. As the ultimate 
          guarantor of the Party’s rule and the PRC’s government system, the PLA’s missions include 
          formal and informal domestic security missions in addition to its national defense missions. 
          Since becoming CMC Chairman, Xi has implemented multiple reforms which reduced PLA autonomy 
          and greatly strengthened Party control over the military. Party leaders and official 
          statements continue to emphasize the principles of the Party’s absolute control over the 
          PLA and the PLA’s loyalty to the Party.

        <h2>China’s Military Leadership</h2>
        <p>
          As the military’s highest decision-making body, the CMC is technically also a department 
          of the CCP Central Committee. The CMC Chairman is a civilian, usually serving concurrently 
          as the General Secretary of the CCP and President of the PRC. CMC members are appointed at 
          Party Congresses every five years. In the fall of 2022 at the 20th Party Congress, General 
          Zhang Youxia ascended to the first Vice Chairman position, joined by General He Weidong 
          as the second Vice Chairman. Other CMC members include General Li Shangfu, General Liu 
          Zhenli, and returning members Admiral Miao Hua and General Zhang Shengmin. In 2022, the 
          CMC consisted of two vice chairs, the Minister of National Defense, the chiefs of the Joint 
          Staff and Political Work Departments, and the head of the Discipline Inspection Commission.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Chairman Xi Jinping</strong> concurrently serves as the CCP General Secretary, CMC 
          Chairman, and President of the PRC. Xi was first appointed as Party General Secretary and 
          CMC Chairman in 2012 and as President in the spring of 2013. Xi was reappointed to all of 
          his positions for an unprecedented third term at 2022’s 20th Party Congress and the 2023 
          National People’s Congress. In 2016, Xi was announced as the commander-in-chief of the 
          CMC’s Joint Operations Command Center (JOCC) and was named “core” leader of the CCP Central 
          Committee. Prior to becoming CMC Chairman, Xi served as the CMC’s only civilian Vice 
          Chairman under Hu Jintao. Xi’s father was an important military figure during China’s 
          communist revolution and was a Politburo member in the 1980s. Xi also served as an aide 
          to a defense minister early in his career and had regular interactions with the PLA as a 
          provincial Party official.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Vice Chairman General Zhang Youxia</strong> is China’s top uniformed official and 
          former junior vice chairman. Zhang was first appointed to the CMC in 2012 as the head of 
          the General Armaments Department – now the Equipment Development Department (EDD) – where 
          he oversaw the PLA’s manned space program, as well as MCF and military modernization 
          efforts. Zhang gained rare experience as a combat commander during China’s brief war with 
          Vietnam in 1979. Zhang formerly commanded the Shenyang Military Region, which shares a 
          border with North Korea and Russia. Zhang is one of the PLA’s “princelings.” His father, a 
          well-known military figure in China, served with Xi’s father at the close of Chinese Civil 
          War in 1949. Zhang, at age 72 in 2022, was expected to retire due to previously followed 
          age norms within the PLA. However, Zhang’s retention on the CMC for a third term probably 
          reflects Xi’s desire to keep a close and experienced ally as his top military advisor.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Vice Chairman General He Weidong</strong> is China’s second-most senior officer and 
          a former commander of the PLA’s Eastern Theater. His ascent to a vice chairman position 
          absent prior CMC membership is unusual and probably a testament to his extensive operational 
          experience focused on Taiwan. Before his selection as vice chairman, He served a brief 
          stint in the CMC JOCC where he played a key role in planning live-fire drills in the Taiwan 
          Strait as part of the PLA response to the then-U.S. House Speaker Pelosi’s August 2022 
          visit to Taipei. He may have close ties to Xi due to their overlapping service in Fujian 
          and Zhejiang provinces in the late 1990s and early 2000s.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Minister of National Defense General Li Shangfu</strong> was appointed to the CMC 
          at the 20th Party Congress in October 2022, and as the Minister of National Defense at the 
          NPC in March 2023. Li is the PLA’s third-most senior officer and manages its relationship 
          with state bureaucracies and foreign militaries. Unlike the U.S. Secretary of Defense, he 
          is not part of the chain of command and his primary policy influence is derived from 
          membership on the CMC and State Council, where he serves as a direct liaison for civil-military 
          integration, defense mobilization, and budgeting. Li previously headed the EDD where he 
          managed the PLA’s weapons development and acquisition efforts and China’s manned space 
          program. In 2018, Li was sanctioned by the United States for his role as EDD director 
          overseeing the purchase of Russian fighter jets and surface-to-air missile systems.

          <strong>Joint Staff Department Chief General Liu Zhenli</strong> oversees PLA joint 
          operations, a narrowing of the wider responsibilities held by the former General Staff 
          Department prior to reforms initiated in 2015. Liu is one of few remaining active-duty 
          PLA officers with combat experience and is recognized as a combat hero for his service 
          in China’s border war with Vietnam. Like his predecessor Li Zuocheng, Liu rose through the 
          ranks of the PLA Army HQ, assuming command of the service in 2021. Beginning in 2015 as 
          Army chief of staff, Liu guided the service through a major period of reform which saw the 
          ground force downgraded to an equal standing with the other branches. Liu, at age 58 in 
          2022, is the youngest CMC member and is eligible to remain on the CMC for at least an 
          additional term.

        <p>
          <strong>Political Work Department Director Admiral Miao Hua</strong> oversees the PLA’s 
          political work, including propaganda, organization, and education. Miao is a former Army 
          officer who switched services to the Navy in December 2014 when he became political 
          commissar of the PLAN. Miao may have ties to Xi from his time serving in the 31st Group 
          Army in Fujian Province, when his career overlapped with Xi’s. Miao participated as the 
          PLAN political commissar during the Navy’s BRIcruise conducted in mid-2017. Miao Hua, at 
          age 66 in 2022, remained on the CMC in his current position following the 20th Party Congress.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Secretary of the Discipline Inspection Commission General Zhang Shengmin</strong> 
          oversees the highest-level organization responsible for investigating military violations 
          of Party discipline, including corrupt practices. Zhang is also a deputy secretary and 
          third-ranking member on the standing committee of the Party’s Discipline Inspection 
          Commission. Zhang’s reappointment reflects the Party’s continued commitment to the 
          anticorruption campaign within the military. Zhang, at age 65 in 2022, remained on the 
          CMC in his current position following the 20th Party Congress.

        <h2>CHAPTER TWO: PLA FORCES, CAPABILITIES, AND POWER PROJECTION</h2>
        <h3>KEY TAKEAWAYS</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The PLA has sought to modernize its capabilities and improve its proficiencies 
            across all warfare domains so that, as a joint force, it can conduct the full range 
            of land, air, and maritime as well as nuclear, space, counterspace, electronic 
            warfare (EW), and cyberspace operations.
          </li>
          <li>
            The PLA’s evolving capabilities and concepts continue to strengthen the PRC’s 
            ability to “fight and win wars” against a “strong enemy (强敌)” (a likely 
            euphemism for the United States), counter an intervention by a third party in a 
            conflict along the PRC’s periphery, and project power globally.
          </li>
          <li>
            In 2022, the PLA continued to make progress implementing major structural reforms, 
            fielding modern indigenous systems, building readiness, and strengthening its 
            competency to conduct joint operations.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The PLA is the world’s largest active-duty military force and comprised of 
          approximately 2.185 million active, 1.17 million reserve, and 660,000 paramilitary 
          personnel for a total force of 4 million. In efforts to create a leaner, more mobile 
          force, the PLA Army (PLAA) has steadily reduced active-duty personnel in the last 
          three decades but still outnumbers other services with roughly 1 million soldiers 
          in 2022. The PLAN and PLA Air Force (PLAAF) have grown in size since 2015, indicating 
          their increasing importance. By 2022, the PLAN Marine Corps expanded from two to six 
          combined arms brigades and was supplemented with aviation and special forces units, 
          with the intent of becoming increasingly capable of protecting China’s overseas 
          interests. The PLA Rocket Force (PLARF), formerly the Second Artillery, manages 
          the PRC’s land-based nuclear and conventional missile units. The Strategic Support 
          Force (SSF) centralizes the PLA’s strategic space, cyberspace, electronic warfare, 
          information, communications, and psychological warfare missions and capabilities. 
          Lastly, the JLSF handles quartermaster, transportation, medical services, and 
          other logistic functions to enhance PLA’s joint capabilities during peace and war.

        <h3>Developments in the PLA’s Modernization and Reform</h3>
        <p>
          The PRC maintains its goal to achieve a fully modernized national defense and military 
          force by 2035 and for the PLA to become a world-class military by 2049. The force also 
          progresses toward its 2027 benchmark of military modernization that aligns with the 
          100th anniversary of the PLA’s founding on August 1, 1927. The 2027 benchmark, introduced 
          during the 14th Five Year Plan (2021-2025), represents the start of the new three-step 
          development strategy that continues Xi’s approach of military reform to transform the 
          PLA. The original three-step modernization strategy sought to achieve mechanization 
          by 2020; modernization of military theory, organization, personnel, and equipment by 2035; 
          and to become a world-class force by mid-century. With basic mechanization considered 
          achieved in 2020, the 2027 goal is a short-term marker and represents a modification, 
          not a compression in timeline, for China’s ambition to achieve complete military 
          modernization of the PLA by 2035.

        <h2>PEOPLE’S LIBERATION ARMY ARMY (PLAA)</h2>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The PLAA continues to modernize equipment and focus on combined arms and joint 
            training in effort to meet the goal of becoming a world-class military.
          </li>
          <li>
            The PLAA demonstrated a new long-range fire capability in the PLA military response 
            to the August 2022 U.S. CODEL visit to Taiwan.
          </li>
          <li>
            The PLAA continues to incorporate a twice-a-year conscript intake. The long-term 
            effects of the policy are not clear.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The PLAA has approximately 970,000 active-duty personnel in combat units and is the 
          primary ground fighting force in the PLA. The 2020 National Defense University’s 
          Science of Military Strategy described the PLAA’s development as a transition from 
          a regional defense to a global combat force.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Force Structure and Organization.</strong> The PLAA continues to replace legacy 
          equipment with newer systems. The major force restructuring required by the 2016 and 
          2017 PLA reforms is complete, but many units are still in the process of upgrading 
          equipment.
        </p>

        <p>
          The PLAA is organized into five Theater Army Commands, the Xinjiang Military District, 
          and the Tibet Military District. The PLAA has 13 group armies, which are comprised of 
          multiple combined-arms brigades that serve as the PLAA’s primary maneuver force. The 
          brigades vary in size and composition. The PLAA delineates its combined-arms brigades 
          into three types: light (high-mobility, mountain, air assault, and motorized), medium 
          (wheeled armored vehicles), and heavy (tracked armored vehicles), with sizes ranging from 
          approximately 4,500 to 5,000 personnel. Each group army controls six additional brigades 
          responsible for operational element functions. Although the PLAA has standardized its 
          group armies, it does retain a number of nonstandard divisions and brigades that exist 
          outside of the group armies. These units are typically located in areas the CCP considers 
          sensitive including Xinjiang, Tibet, Hong Kong, and Beijing.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Capabilities and Modernization.</strong> To meet the stated ambitions to become 
          a world-class military, the PLAA continues systems modernization and combined arms 
          and joint training. However, they still employ a mix of modern and legacy military 
          equipment. The PLAA continues focusing training on fighting as combined arms 
          formations while adapting to the twice-a-year conscript induction change.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Readiness.</strong> In 2022, the PLAA continued to improve its methods and 
          standards of training combined arms units. Training encompassed individual to collective 
          soldier events integrating reconnaissance, infantry, artillery, armor, engineers, and 
          signal units. In addition to continued PLAA deployments to the LAC on the Indian border, 
          the PLAA conducted multiple “around the clock” large-scale exercises in training areas 
          throughout the country to include joint operations in response to the U.S. and Taiwan 
          actions in 2022.

        <h2>PEOPLE’S LIBERATION ARMY NAVY (PLAN)</h2>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The PRC has numerically the largest navy in the world with an overall battle 
            force of over 370 ships and submarines, including more than 140 major surface 
            combatants. The PLAN is largely composed of modern multi-mission ships and 
            submarines.
          </li>
          <li>
            The PLAN commissioned its eighth RENHAI class cruiser in late 2022 and is continuing 
            construction of the RENHAI Guided Missile Cruiser (CG), the LUYANG III MOD Guided 
            Missile Destroyer (DDG), and the JIANGKAI II Guided Missile Frigate (FFG), as well 
            as beginning production on a new class of frigate, the JIANGKAI III.
          </li>
          <li>
            In 2022, the PLAN commissioned its third YUSHEN-class Amphibious Assault Ship (LHA) 
            and has likely begun construction on a fourth as of early 2023.
          </li>
          <li>
            In 2022, the PLAN launched its third aircraft carrier, CV-18 Fujian.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the near-term, the PLAN will have the ability to conduct long-range precision 
            strikes against land targets from its submarine and surface combatants using land-attack 
            cruise missiles, notably enhancing the PRC’s power projection capability.
          </li>
          <li>
            The PRC continues to challenge foreign military activities in its EEZ in a manner 
            that is inconsistent with the rules of customary international law as reflected in 
            the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. At the same time, the PLAN 
            conducts activities in the EEZs of other countries, including the United States, 
            Australia, Philippines, Vietnam, and Malaysia.

        <h2>PEOPLE’S LIBERATION ARMY AIR FORCE (PLAAF) AND PLAN AVIATION</h2>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The PLAAF and PLAN Aviation together constitute the largest aviation force in the 
            Indo-Pacific region.
          </li>
          <li>
            The PLAAF is rapidly catching up to Western air forces. The PLAAF continues to 
            modernize with the delivery of domestically built aircraft and a wide range of UASs.
          </li>
          <li>
            In October 2019, the PRC signaled the return of the airborne leg of its nuclear 
            triad after the PLAAF publicly revealed the H-6N as its first nuclear-capable 
            air-to-air refuelable bomber.

        <h2>PEOPLE’S LIBERATION ARMY ROCKET FORCE (PLARF)</h2>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The PLARF is advancing its long-term modernization plans to enhance its 
            “strategic deterrence” capabilities.
          </li>
          <li>
            The PRC probably completed the construction of its three new solid-propellant 
            silo fields in 2022, which will cumulatively contain at least 300 new ICBM silos, 
            and has loaded at least some intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) into these 
            silos.
          </li>
          <li>
            The PRC is developing new ICBMs that will significantly improve its nuclear-capable 
            missile forces and will require increased nuclear warhead production, partially due 
            to the introduction of multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle (MIRV) 
            capabilities.
          </li>
          <li>
            The PRC may be exploring development of conventionally-armed intercontinental 
            range missile systems. If developed and fielded, such capabilities would allow 
            the PRC to threaten conventional strikes against targets in the continental United 
            States, Hawaii, and Alaska. Conventionally-armed ICBMs would present significant 
            risks to strategic stability.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The PLARF organizes, mans, trains, and equips the PRC’s strategic land-based nuclear 
          and conventional missile forces and associated support forces and missile bases. The 
          PLARF is a critical component of the PRC’s nuclear deterrence strategy and its strategy 
          to deter and counter third-party intervention in regional conflicts.

        <h2>STRATEGIC SUPPORT FORCE (SSF)</h2>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The SSF is a theater command-level organization established to centralize the PLA’s
            strategic space, cyberspace, electronic, information, communications, and
            psychological warfare missions and capabilities.
          </li>
          <li>
            The SSF’s Network Systems Department (NSD), sometimes referred to as the Cyberspace
            Force (CSF; 网络空间部队) is responsible for information warfare with an integrated
            mission set that includes cyberspace warfare, technical reconnaissance, electronic
            warfare, and psychological warfare. The PLA SSF’s Space Systems Department (SSD),
            sometimes referred to as the Aerospace Force (ASF; 航天部队), is responsible for
            military space operations.
          </li>
          <li>
            The PRC continues to develop counterspace capabilities—including direct-ascent
            anti-satellite missiles, co-orbital satellites, electronic warfare, and
            directed-energy systems—that can contest or deny an adversary’s access to and
            operations in the space domain during a crisis or conflict.
          </li>
          <li>
            The PRC’s space enterprise continues to mature rapidly and Beijing has devoted
            significant resources to growing all aspects of its space program, from military
            space applications to civil applications such as profit-generating launches,
            scientific endeavors, and space exploration. SSF works with civilian organizations,
            such as universities and research organization, to integrate civilian support to
            military efforts.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The SSF was established in 2015 to centralize the PLA’s strategic space, cyberspace,
          electronic, and psychological warfare missions and capabilities. The SSF reports
          directly to the CMC and supports the entire PLA with its capabilities. The PRC’s 2019
          defense white paper described the SSF’s modernization goals as “seeking to achieve big
          development strides in key areas and accelerate the integrated development of new-type
          combat forces, so as to build a strong and modernized strategic support force.”
        </p>

        <p>
          The SSF oversees two deputy theater command-level departments: the SSD, sometimes
          referred to as the ASF, is responsible for military space operations, and the NSD,
          sometimes referred to as the CSF, responsible for information operations (IO), which
          includes technical reconnaissance, EW, cyberspace warfare, and psychological
          operations. At the headquarters level, the SSF has a four-department administrative
          structure that includes the Staff, Equipment, Political Work, and Logistics
          Departments. As a strategic organization, the SSF is directly subordinate to the CMC,
          but some of its subordinate units may report to the theater commands in wartime. The
          SSF provides information support derived from space-, cyber-, and terrestrial-based
          means to all PLA services and the five joint theater commands. Civilian reserve and
          militia units – typically comprised of personnel from the Ministry of Information and
          Industry Technology, Ministry of Public Security, Ministry of State Security, and
          academic institutions – augment SSF cyberspace operations during peacetime and are
          organized into specialized units during wartime to support network defense operations.
        </p>

        <p>
          General Ju Qiansheng has served as SSF commander since 2021. He previously served as
          commander of the NSD. Lt. Gen. Shang Hong recently served as commander of the SSD,
          until leaving that position sometime in 2023, but a replacement has not been
          identified. The leader of the NSD is unknown.
        </p>

        <h3>Network Systems Department</h3>
        <p>
          The SSF NSD, also referred to as the CSF, is responsible for information warfare with a
          mission set that includes cyberspace warfare, technical reconnaissance, EW, and
          psychological warfare. By placing the SSF NSD missions under the same organizational
          umbrella, the PRC seeks to remedy the operational coordination challenges that hindered
          information sharing under the PLA’s pre-reform organizational structure. The
          incorporation of cyberspace and EW elements under one organization was a crucial step
          towards realizing the operational concept of integrated network and electronic warfare
          that the PLA has envisioned since the early 2000s. The NSD operates five theater–aligned
          technical reconnaissance bases, a number of signals intelligence bureaus, and several
          research institutes. The NSD provides intelligence support to the theater commands by
          leveraging a diverse suite of ground-based technical collection assets to provide a
          common operating picture to geographically dispersed operational units.
        </p>

        <p>
          The SSF and the “Three Warfares” Concept: The SSF NSD, or CSF, performs missions and
          tasks associated with the PLA’s concept of “Three Warfares,” which comprises
          psychological warfare, public opinion warfare, and legal warfare. This department is
          the only publicly known organization in the PLA that performs psychological warfare
          operations. See 2022 CMPR “Special Topic: PRC Views of Information and Information
          Dominance” for more on PLA views on information warfare, including psychological
          warfare.
        </p>

        <h3>SSF Space Systems Department</h3>
        <p>
          The SSD, sometimes referred to as the ASF, is responsible for nearly all PLA space
          operations, including space launch and support; space surveillance; space information
          support; space telemetry, tracking, and control; and space warfare. The PRC seeks to
          enhance the PLA’s command and control C2 for joint operations and establish a real-time
          surveillance, reconnaissance, and warning system, and it is increasing the number and
          capabilities of its space systems, including communications and intelligence
          satellites, as well as the BeiDou navigation satellite system.
        </p>

        <p>
          The SSD operates at least eight bases, including those whose core missions are the
          launch, tracking, R&amp;D, and operation of the satellites vital to the PRC’s overhead
          C4ISR architecture. The SSD operates tracking, telemetry, and command (TT&amp;C)
          stations in multiple locations worldwide to guide space missions around the Earth as
          well as in cislunar and deep space. The SSD also operates Yuanwang space support ships
          that track satellite and ICBM launches.
        </p>

        <p>
          China has five launch sites, including four land-based and one sea-based. The SSD’s
          China Launch and Tracking Control (CLTC) operates all four fixed launch sites in China,
          in addition to Yuanwang space support ships (SESS), two major satellite control
          centers—Xian Satellite Control Center (XSCC) and the Beijing Aerospace Control Center
          (BACC)—and the PLA TT&amp;C system for all Chinese satellites.
        </p>

        <p>
          Other Space and Counterspace Organizations. The PRC’s space program comprises
          organizations in the military, civil, defense-industrial, and commercial sectors. The
          PLA historically has managed the PRC’s space program and continues to support both
          civilian and military interests. This includes strengthening and investing in its
          science and technology sector, growing international partnerships, and improving the
          PRC’s capabilities in space-based ISR, SATCOM, satellite navigation, human spaceflight,
          and robotic space exploration. Although state-owned enterprises are China’s primary
          space contractors, the PRC is placing greater emphasis on decentralizing and
          diversifying its space industry to increase competition.
        </p>

        <p>
          The State Council’s State Administration for Science, Technology, and Industry for
          National Defense (SASTIND) is the primary civilian organization that coordinates and
          manages the PRC’s space activities, including allocating space research and development
          funds. It also maintains a working relationship with the PLA organization that oversees
          the PRC’s military acquisitions. SASTIND guides and establishes policies for
          state-owned entities conducting the PRC’s space activities.
        </p>

        <p>
          The China National Space Administration (CNSA), subordinate to SASTIND, conducts
          China’s civilian space efforts, including human spaceflight at the Chinese space
          station, lunar missions, and interplanetary missions. The PRC is increasingly using
          CNSA efforts to bolster relationships with countries around the world, particularly
          with the BRI Partners, providing opportunities to cooperate on space issues.
        </p>

        <p>
          Many space technologies can serve a civilian and military purpose and the PRC
          emphasizes “military-civil fusion”—a phrase used, in part, to refer to the use of
          dual-use technologies, policies, and organizations for military benefit. The SSF works
          with civilian organizations like universities and research organizations to incorporate
          civilian support to military efforts since there is an already high demand for
          aerospace talent and competition for finite human resources. China also has a growing
          commercial space sector that supports government objectives, including remote sensing,
          launch, and communication services.
        </p>

        <p>
          International Cooperation. The PRC has extensive civil space cooperation agreements
          around the world and is an exporter of satellites and space technology. It has more
          than a hundred cooperative space-related agreements with more than three dozen
          countries and four international organizations. The PRC is inviting countries to
          participate on the Chinese space station or International Lunar Research Station, which
          is jointly led by China and Russia, and has sold satellite launching services and
          ground stations to countries around the world.
        </p>

        <p>
          China leads the Asia-Pacific Space Cooperation Organization (APSCO), a multilateral
          organization with rotating leadership whose members include Bangladesh, Iran,
          Mongolia, Pakistan, Peru, Thailand, and Turkey with Egypt, Indonesia, and Mexico as
          associate members. APSCO oversees a network of space surveillance telescopes and
          tasking information, and the observation data it collects is funneled through the
          Chinese Academy of Science’s National Astronomical Observatory of China. The
          organization is planning to improve optical system capabilities, coverage, and
          redundancy as well as data sharing networks.

        <h3>Major SSF Installations</h3>

        <h2>JOINT LOGISTIC SUPPORT FORCE (JLSF)</h2>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The JLSF is concentrating its efforts on improving joint strategic and campaign-level
            logistic efficiencies through training and integrating civilian products and services.
          </li>
          <li>
            The JLSF supports multimodal transportation methods to facilitate the movement of
            PLA forces and equipment for training.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The PLA JLSF, established in 2016, provides integrated joint logistics support for the
          PLA. The JLSF commander is Lt. Gen. Wang Liyan. The JLSF is directly subordinate to
          the CMC and is central to China’s efforts to build a joint, efficient “combat-oriented
          modern logistics system,” which Beijing views as essential for modern warfare. The
          JLSF modernizes PLA strategic- and campaign-level logistics by overseeing theater wide
          supply operations, establishing and coordinating support relationships among PLA
          service logistics elements conducting joint logistics exercises with the PLA services,
          and integrating civilian logistics resources into military operations. The JLSF
          conducts exercises to improve the PLA’s ability to conduct joint logistics operations.
        </p>

        <p>
          The JLSF is headquartered at Wuhan Joint Logistics Support Base. It operates five joint
          logistics support centers (JLSCs) aligned with each of the theater commands that are
          intended to streamline logistics support to the PLA. Under the JLSCs’ control are units
          that provide materiel support to the PLA and joint logistics support brigades (JLSBs),
          who focus exclusively on providing mobile logistics support during combat operations.
        </p>

        <p>
          The JLSF provides the PLA with joint strategic- and campaign-level logistics, enabling
          the PLA to conduct large-scale operations. Elements of the JLSF who provide direct
          wartime support to the PLA fighting force are categorized as weapons and ammunition
          storage, warehousing, medical services, transport, fuel, engineering and construction
          management, reserve equipment, and procurement support. During peacetime, the JLSF has
          authority over the JLSCs’ operations and activities; during wartime, theater commands
          possibly would assume control of their designated JLSC.
        </p>

        <p>
          The JLSF integrates civilian resources and equipment into military operations and
          exercises, leveraging China’s civilian products, services and transportation, to
          improve resupply and move military personnel and equipment more rapidly. It does so
          primarily through the use of military representative offices (MROs) comprised of JLSF
          personnel who embed with civilian transportation companies (air, rail, road, and sea)
          to plan and manage military transportation. MRO personnel are vital to the JLSF’s
          military-civilian integration efforts because they understand the technical loading
          procedures for various modes of transportation, can draft load plans, and provide
          expertise to reduce load times at points of embarkation. JLSF theater dispatch centers
          are the headquarters of regional MROs, coordinate PLA mobilization, and are tasked with
          improving the efficiency of transferring materials and forces between transportation
          modes.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>PLA Training to Improve Readiness.</strong> The CMC sought to improve PLA combat
          readiness, interoperability, and training through the 14th Five-Year Plan and
          reinforced these priorities through military training mobilization orders and senior
          leadership guidance. In 2022, Xi emphasized the need for the PLA to adopt the latest
          technologies in its training and to focus on integrating training with combat
          operations The PLA conducted multiple large-scale joint exercises and incorporated
          advanced weapons and equipment, such as during the exercises around Taiwan in August.
        </p>

        <p>
          Throughout 2022, the PLA sustained the frequency, scale, and duration of joint
          exercises. The COVID-19 pandemic likely did not significantly impact the PLA’s ability
          to conduct joint exercises. The PLA successfully completed at least eight bilateral and
          multinational exercises, conducting naval drills, maritime and aerial patrols, and
          humanitarian assistance and disaster relief efforts. Although the PLA has improved some
          combat deficiencies, the force, as a whole, probably continues to work through
          challenges with joint operations, command and control, and tactical and small-unit
          leadership.
        </p>

        <p>
          The largest unplanned event of the year occurred in August 2022, when the PLA
          conducted live-fire drills—including firing ballistic missiles over Taiwan—in response
          to the CODEL visit to Taipei in August 2022. During the visit, Taiwan’s defense
          ministry reported that 27 PLA aircraft entered Taiwan’s air defense identification
          zone, including 22 that crossed the median of the Taiwan Strait. The PLA’s centerline
          crossings have continued since August as the PLA maintains a heightened readiness
          level. Such activity reflects ongoing PLA attempts to normalize median line crossings.
        </p>

        <h2>INCREASING OPERABILITY WITH PLA RESERVES, PARAMILITARY &amp; MILITIA</h2>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Interoperability and integration between the PLA, its reserve components, and the
            PRC’s paramilitary forces continue to grow in scale and sophistication, including
            the coordination between the PLAN, the China Coast Guard (CCG), and the China
            Maritime Militia (CMM).

            The PRC primarily uses paramilitary maritime organizations in maritime disputes,
            selectively using the PLAN to provide overwatch in case of escalation.

        </ul>

        <p>
          The PRC’s internal security forces consist primarily of the Ministry of Public
          Security (MPS), the Ministry of State Security (MSS), the People’s Armed Police (PAP),
          the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), and the militia. The CCP relies on these forces to
          address challenges ranging from protests over political, social, environmental, or
          economic problems, to terrorism and natural disasters. In 2022, the PRC deployed
          thousands of PLA, PAP, and militia personnel for disaster relief in response to
          multiple events such as an airplane crash, earthquakes, fires, and floods.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Ministry of Public Security (MPS).</strong> The MPS leads the PRC’s civilian
          national police, which serves as the front force for public order. The key mission of
          the MPS is domestic law enforcement and the “maintenance of social security and order”
          with duties including anti-rioting and anti-terrorism.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Ministry of State Security (MSS).</strong> The MSS is the PRC’s main civilian
          intelligence and counterintelligence service. MSS operations include but are not
          limited to: protect the PRC’s national security; conduct counterintelligence; combating
          foreign espionage; and investigate organizations or individuals inside the PRC who
          carry out or direct, support, or aid other people perceived to threaten national
          security. On April 26th, 2021, the PRC enacted a new counter-espionage law permitting
          the MSS authority to identify companies and organizations deemed susceptible to foreign
          infiltration or influence and require these institutes to implement measures to prevent
          foreign infiltration.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>People’s Armed Police (PAP).</strong> The PAP is a paramilitary component of the
          PRC’s armed forces. Its primary missions include internal security, maritime security,
          and augmentation to the PLA during conflict. As part of a security structures
          reorganization in 2018, the CMC centralized control of the PAP. The same reform also
          subordinated the CCG to the PAP.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>People’s Liberation Army (PLA).</strong> In addition to its national defense
          mission, the PLA has formal and informal roles in the PRC’s internal security. As the
          principal armed wing of the CCP, the PLA is the ultimate guarantor of the CCP’s
          survival and supports other internal security forces as necessary. The 2020 National
          Defense Law recognizes this role in assigning the PLA the mission to “consolidate the
          leadership of the Communist Party of China and the socialist system” in addition to
          external defense tasks.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Militia.</strong> The PRC’s militia is a force that can be mobilized for a variety
          of peace- and war-time missions and is distinct from the PLA’s Reserve Force. The
          militia is organized by townships, administrative villages, urban sub-districts, and
          enterprises and institutions, and the missions may vary widely. In wartime, militia
          units assist the PLA with its military operations, conduct independent security
          operations, and provide support and manpower replacement to the PLA. During peacetime,
          the militia assists in humanitarian aid and disaster relief, supports military
          training, and maintains internal security. The PRC’s Military Service Law requires male
          citizens between 18 to 35 years of age who are fit for military service, excluding
          those already in active service, be enrolled into the militia. The militia is divided
          into two categories. The primary militia consists of former soldiers, personnel that
          have received military training, and personnel selected for military training that are
          under the age of 28, in good health, and politically reliable. The remainder of male
          citizens between 18 and 35 years of age are considered ordinary militia. The primary
          militia may recruit female citizens when necessary and the age limits can be waived
          under special circumstance. Local maritime militia forces, referred to by many western
          analysts as the Chinese Maritime Militia, perform tasks including safeguarding
          maritime claims, protecting fisheries, providing logistic support, search and rescue,
          and surveillance and reconnaissance, often in conjunction or coordination with the PLAN
          and the CCG.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>People’s Liberation Army Reserve Force.</strong> The People’s Liberation Army
          Reserve Force was founded in 1983 and professionalized throughout the 1990s and 2000s.
          On July 1st, 2020, the PRC amended laws, regulations, and policies to bring the Reserve
          Force under the command of the Central Committee of the CCP and the CMC. The previous
          arrangement split control of the Reserve Force between the PLA and local Party
          committees. Motivations for the change include improving combat capability,
          facilitating cooperation with active-duty units, and upholding the CCP’s absolute
          leadership over the military. Chinese sources often stated specifically that the reform
          would enhance reserve performance in Tibet and Xinjiang. Additionally, the PLA appears
          to have begun making a partial restructure towards using a PLAA reserve base system to
          continue to improve facilitation and support for active-duty units.
        </p>

        <p>
          The PLA Reserve Force is comprised of approximately 510,000 personnel subordinate to
          the Army Reserve, Navy Reserve, Air Force Reserve, and Rocket Force Reserve.
          According to PLA documents, active-duty personnel are the backbone of the Reserve
          Force, but reserve-duty officers and soldiers are its foundation. 2020 National Defense
          University's Science of Military Strategy states the building of the reserve force is an
          important part of national defense construction and is the basic and strategic project
          to consolidate national defense. The primary mission of the reserves is to reinforce
          active-duty forces for national defense, with a secondary mission to aid in national
          disasters or maintaining social order.The Reserve Force should be prepared to
          effectively respond to a variety of emergencies and military threats, safeguard
          national sovereignty, security and development interests, and the core security of the
          country.
        </p>

        <p>
          Although originally founded to support the ground forces, reforms in recent years seek
          to reduce PLAA reserves and increase those for the PLAN, PLAAF, and the PLARF. However,
          PRC writings suggest that, as of 2018, the Reserve Force was still predominately ground
          force-centric, with less than 10 percent of reservists serving specialized technical
          functions in the PLAN, PLAAF, PLARF, or PLA SSF.
        </p>

        <p>
          Reserve officers are selected from veteran PLA officers, local officials, PAP or militia
          officers, and other technical personnel. Reserve soldiers are selected from eligible PLA
          veterans, trained grass-roots militias, and other local or military specialty
          personnel. Some reserve soldiers also failed to meet active-duty entry requirements and
          conduct remedial training in the reserves until they are able to join the active-duty
          force.
        </p>

        <p>
          The PLA is working to improve reserve mobilization, which anecdotal evidence suggests
          is hindered by unclear processes. In March 2023, during the PRC’s annual “Two
          Sessions,” PLA deputies suggested that the PRC should study and prioritize wartime
          legislation, including the introduction of laws such as the mobilization of reserve
          forces. Chinese documents also suggest that Reserve Force equipment is old; one report
          in 2018 stated that more than 70 percent of air defense artillery and artillery
          equipment is at or beyond its maximum service life. Some of the equipment is no longer
          manufactured and repair requires cannibalization.
        </p>

        <p>
          The PLA Reserve Force does not include militias, the Civil Air Defense, or myriad other
          groups (e.g., the People’s Armed Police or the Xinjiang Production and Construction
          Corps (XPCC)).
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>People's Armed Police (PAP).</strong> The PAP is a component of the PRC’s armed
          forces and an armed wing of the CCP with an estimated 660,000 personnel. In the 2020
          National Defense University's Science of Military Strategy, the primary
          responsibilities of the PAP include maintaining political, institutional and regime
          security, handling emergency rescue, counter-terrorism, air support, maritime rights
          protection, administrative law enforcement, and defense operations. The PAP is
          organized into three main parts: the Internal Security Corps, the Mobile Corps, and the
          CCG. The Internal Security Corps covers each of the PRC’s provinces, provincial-level
          cities, and “autonomous” regions. There is not yet a reported permanent presence of the
          PAP in the Special Administrative Regions (SARs) of Hong Kong or Macao. The Mobile
          Corps is comprised of myriad PAP units placed to reinforce the Internal Security Corps
          and provide flexibility in responding to internal security issues. Mobile Corps units
          are concentrated around non-Han ethnic regions in the West and South (Xinjiang, Tibet,
          Sichuan, Yunnan, and Qinghai) as well as the major cities of Beijing and Shanghai.
          Xinjiang is a particular focus of the PAP due to alleged separatist activity, as well as
          its proximity to areas of unrest in Central Asia.
        </p>

        <p>
          On July 1st, 2020, the standing committee of the PRC’s legislature, the National
          People’s Congress, approved a revision to the Law on the People’s Armed Police Force
          which officially recognized the CMC singular command of the PAP, identified the PAP as
          an important part of the armed forces that fall under the leadership of the CCP, as
          well as affirming its primary mission set of handling security emergencies, maintaining
          stability, conducting counter-terrorism operations, and executing maritime law
          enforcement and rescue. This legal amendment codified and deepened the substantial
          reforms of 2018, when command of the PAP was centralized under the Central Party
          Committee and the CMC after decades of dual-leadership under the CMC and State Council
          (a PRC government body); the China Coast Guard was subordinated to the PAP; and myriad
          auxiliary duties (e.g., protecting gold mines, firefighting, etc.) were removed from
          the PAP’s purview to focus its mission on PRC domestic and international security.
          Chinese media noted that the 2020 PAP reforms included an article that permitted the PAP
          to conduct certain operations, including counter-terrorism training, outside of the PRC.
        </p>

        <p>
          Xi and the CCP leadership tasked the PAP with integrating themselves into the PLA’s
          joint operation system. The PAP is increasingly focused on internal security and joint
          operations with the PLA and is developing capabilities for rapid response, mobility,
          and counterterrorism operations. The PAP also conducts training with foreign partners,
          including at least Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Russia. Since at least 2016, PAP forces
          have likely operated in Tajikistan, patrolling the tri-border region connecting
          Tajikistan, Afghanistan, and the PRC.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 2022, PAP forces performed rescue operations in Xining following major flooding in
          August and in Sichuan after a September 5th earthquake and acquired new helicopters to
          support in counter-terrorism and disaster relief tasks. An emphasis was also placed on
          PAP SOF training throughout the year, including a maritime tactical joint exercise in
          June with PLANMC. Additionally, a PAP officer was named as the commander of the PLA
          Garrison in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, showing a PRC focus of
          maintaining social stability based on the new commander’s counter-terrorism experience
          in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>China Coast Guard (CCG).</strong> The CCG is subordinate to the PAP and is
          responsible for a wide range of maritime security missions, including defending the
          PRC’s sovereignty claims; combating smuggling, terrorism, and environmental crimes; as
          well as supporting international cooperation. In 2021, the Standing Committee of
          China’s National People’s Congress passed the Coast Guard Law which took effect on 1
          February 2021. The legislation regulates the duties of the CCG, to include the use of
          force, and applies those duties to seas under the jurisdiction of the PRC. The law was
          met with concern by other regional countries that may perceive the law as an implicit
          threat to use force, especially as territorial disputes in the region continue.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since the law, CCG activity has continued to prompt regional concern. In March 2022,
          the Philippines lodged a diplomatic protest against the PRC after a CCG vessel
          reportedly engaged in “close distance maneuvering” near a Filipino vessel in the
          disputed Scarborough Shoal. In December 2022, Japan reported that CCG vessels stayed in
          its territorial waters for over 72 hours, the longest continuous intrusion since 2012.
        </p>

        <p>
          The CCG’s continued expansion and modernization makes it the largest maritime law
          enforcement fleet in the world. Newer CCG vessels are larger and more capable than
          older vessels, allowing them to operate further offshore and remain on station longer.
          While exact numbers are unavailable, open-source reporting and commercial imagery
          counts indicate the CCG has over 150 regional and oceangoing patrol vessels (more than
          1,000 tons). These larger vessels include over 20 corvettes transferred from the PLAN,
          which were modified for CCG operations. , The newer, larger CCG vessels are equipped
          with helicopter facilities, high-capacity water cannons, multiple interceptor boats and
          guns ranging from 20 to 76 millimeters., Revised estimates indicate the CCG operates
          more than 50 regional patrol combatants (more than 500 tons), which can be used for
          limited offshore operations, and an additional 300 coastal patrol craft (100 to 499
          tons).
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>China’s Maritime Militia (CMM).</strong> China’s Maritime Militia (CMM) is a
          subset of the PRC’s national militia, an armed reserve force of civilians available for
          mobilization that is ultimately subordinate to the CMC through the National Defense
          Mobilization Department. Throughout China, militia units organize around towns,
          villages, urban sub-districts, and enterprises and vary widely in composition and
          mission. CMM vessels train with and assist the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) and
          the China Coast Guard (CCG) in tasks such as safeguarding maritime claims, surveillance
          and reconnaissance, fisheries protection, logistics support, and search and rescue.
          These operations traditionally take place within the FIC along China’s coast and near
          disputed features in the SCS such as the Second Thomas Shoal, Scarborough Reed, and
          Luconia Shoal. However, the presence of possible CMM vessels mixed in with Chinese
          fishing vessels near Indonesia’s Natuna Island outside of the “nine-dashed line” on
          Chinese maps indicated a possible ambition to expand CMM operations within the region.
          The PRC employs the CMM in gray zone operations, or “low-intensity maritime rights
          protection struggles,” at a level designed to frustrate effective response by the other
          parties involved. The PRC employs CMM vessels to advance its disputed sovereignty
          claims, often amassing them in disputed areas throughout the SCS and ECS. In this
          manner, the CMM plays a major role in coercive activities to achieve the PRC’s
          political goals without fighting and these operations are part of broader Chinese
          military theory that sees confrontational operations short of war as an effective means
          of accomplishing strategic objectives.
        </p>

        <p>
          CMM units have been active for decades in incidents and combat operations throughout
          China’s near seas and in these incidents CMM vessels are often used to supplement CCG
          cutters at the forefront of the incident, giving the Chinese the capacity to outweigh
          and outlast rival claimants. From September 2021 to September 2022, maritime militia
          vessels were a constant presence near Iroquois Reef in the Spratly Islands within the
          Philippines EEZ. Other notable examples include standoffs with the Malaysia drill ship
          West Capella (2020), defense of China’s HYSY-981 drill rig in waters disputed with
          Vietnam (2014), occupation of Scarborough Reef (2012), and harassment of USNS
          Impeccable and Howard O. Lorenzen (2009 and 2014). Historically, the maritime militia
          also participated in China’s offshore island campaigns in the 1950s, the 1974 seizure
          of the Paracel Islands from South Vietnam, the occupation of Mischief Reef in the
          Spratly Islands in 1994.
        </p>

        <p>
          The CMM also protects and facilitates Chinese fishing vessels operating in disputed
          waters. From late December 2019 to mid-January 2020, a large fleet of over 50 Chinese
          fishing vessels operated under the escort of multiple China Coast Guard patrol ships in
          Indonesian claimed waters northeast of the Natuna Islands. At least a portion of the
          Chinese ships in this fishing fleet were affiliated with known traditional maritime
          militia units, including a maritime militia unit based out of Beihai City in Guangxi
          province. While most traditional maritime militia units operating in the SCS continue
          to originate from townships and ports on Hainan Island, Beihai is one of a number of
          increasingly prominent maritime militia units based out of provinces in mainland China.
          These mainland based maritime militia units routinely operate in the Spratly Islands
          and in the southern SCS, and their operations in these areas are enabled by increased
          funding from the Chinese government to improve their maritime capabilities and grow
          their ranks of personnel.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>CMM and Land Reclamation in the South China Sea.</strong> Since at least 2014, 
          CMM vessels have engaged in covert small scale reclamation activity and likely caused 
          physical changes observed at multiple unoccupied features in the Spratly Islands, 
          including Lankiam Cay, Eldad Reef, Sandy Cay, and Whitsun Reef. Beijing likely is 
          attempting to covertly alter these features so that it can portray them as naturally 
          formed high tide elevations capable of supporting PRC maritime claims out to the farthest 
          extent of the nine-nash line. In contrast to the PRC large-scale reclamation program, 
          which was overt and where the original status of occupied features is well documented, 
          the less well-known historical record about many of the unoccupied features makes them 
          more susceptible to PRC efforts to shape international opinion regarding the status 
          of the features.
        </p>

        <p>
          Through the National Defense Mobilization Department, Beijing subsidizes various local
          and provincial commercial organizations to operate CMM vessels to perform “official”
          missions on an ad hoc basis outside of their regular civilian commercial activities. CMM
          units employ marine industry workers, usually fishermen, as a supplement to the PLAN
          and the CCG. While retaining their day jobs, these mariners are organized and trained,
          often by the PLAN and the CCG, and can be activated on demand.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since 2014, China has built a new Spratly backbone fleet comprising at least 235 large
          steel-hulled fishing vessels, many longer than 50 meters and displacing more than 500
          tons. These vessels were built under central direction from the PRC government to
          operate in disputed areas south of 12 degrees latitude that China typically refers to as
          the “Spratly Waters,” including the Spratly Islands and southern SCS. Spratly backbone
          vessels were built for prominent CMM units in Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hainan
          Provinces. For vessel owners not already affiliated with CMM units, joining the militia
          was a precondition for receiving government funding to build new Spratly backbone
          boats. As with the CCG and PLAN, new facilities in the Paracel and Spratly Islands
          enhance the CMM’s ability to sustain operations in the SCS.
        </p>

        <p>
          Starting in 2015, the Sansha City Maritime Militia in the Paracel Islands has been
          developed into a salaried full-time maritime militia force with its own command center
          and equipped with at least 84 purpose-built vessels armed with mast-mounted water
          cannons for spraying and reinforced steel hulls for ramming. Freed from their normal
          fishing responsibilities, Sansha City Maritime Militia personnel – many of whom are
          former PLAN and CCG sailors – train for peacetime and wartime contingencies, often with
          light arms, and patrol regularly around disputed South China Sea features even during
          fishing moratoriums.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Tanmen Maritime Militia is another prominent CMM unit. Homeported in Tanmen
          township on Hainan Island, the formation was described by Xi as a “model maritime
          militia unit” during a visit to Tanmen harbor in 2013. During the visit, Xi encouraged
          Tanmen to support “island and reef development” in the SCS. Between 1989 and 1995, the
          Tanmen Maritime Militia, under the authority of the PLAN Southern Theater Navy (then
          the South Sea Fleet), was involved in the occupation and reclamation of PRC outposts in
          the Spratly Islands, including Subi Reef, Fiery Cross Reef, and Mischief Reef.

        <h2>SPECIAL OPERATIONS FORCES</h2>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Despite unilateral and multilateral training, all of China’s SOF units lack
            real-world combat experience.
          </li>
          <li>
            China’s SOF does not have a national-level special operations command to oversee all
            of China’s SOF activities.
          </li>
          <li>
            Despite an emphasis to conduct joint training, theater commanders have no authority
            over PAP units, making it difficult to incorporate PAP SOF into PLA training
            exercises.
          </li>
          <li>
            The PRC categorizes its non-traditional security threats as terrorism (domestic and
            international), separatism (entities looking to break away from China such Taiwan,
            Tibet, and the Uyghur minority population in western China), and extremism (primarily
            religious).
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          In late 2015, the PRC’s SOF were impacted by a series of reforms that aimed to
          “reorganize troops and rebuild new-type combat forces. New types of combat forces have
          been enhanced to conduct special operations, all-dimensional offense and defense,
          amphibious operations, far seas protection, and strategic projection, aiming to make
          the force composition complete, combined, multi-functional, and flexible.” In 2016,
          additional changes to Chinese law were made authorizing the PRC’s SOF to conduct
          operations outside of China’s borders.

        <p>
          <strong>Mission.</strong> The PRC’s SOF are tasked to conduct three primary missions;
          direct action, special reconnaissance, and counterterrorism. The goal of the PRC’s SOF
          operations are to prepare the battlefield for their conventional force counterparts by
          attacking critical areas, degrading enemy operational systems and capabilities, and
          delaying or disrupting enemy operational activities. In conventional warfare, the PRC’s
          SOF missions include, but are not limited to, disrupting rear echelon formations and
          activities, destroying or securing key targets, decapitation, and targeting for fire
          support. The PRC’s SOF can also conduct humanitarian aid and disaster relief (HADR)
          missions, noncombatant evacuation operations (NEO), and personal security assignments.
          While PLA SOF can conduct counterterrorism missions, PAP SOF are specifically tasked
          with this mission. The PRC categorizes its non-traditional security threats as
          terrorism, separatism, and extremism.

          lines, land navigation, reconnaissance, targeting, blocking maneuvers, and first aid.
          PLAA SOF units from the Eastern Theater Command train for maritime missions by
          swimming, maneuvering small rubber boats, marksmanship from moving boats, and scuba
          diving. In a 2016 exercise, forces from a Southern Theater Command Army SOF Brigade
          (BDE) conducted an air assault mission off the coast then traveled 5 km to the
          shoreline.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>PLA Navy Marine Corps SOF.</strong> PLANMC SOF are trained to conduct groundbased special operations, as well as coastal and maritime missions, including maritime
          counterterrorism, HADR, NEO and visit, board, search and seizure operations. They train
          for more than a year learning airborne, rappelling, reconnaissance, secure
          communication, navigation, driving, search and seizure, demolition, and hand-to-hand
          combat skills. They also practice deploying rubber boats and fast-roping from
          helicopters into the water. In December 2020, PLANMC SOF participated in a combined
          arms island seizure exercise with mechanized infantry units where the SOF used mineclearing line charges to destroy obstacles with sniper teams in overwatch.

        <p>
          <strong>PLA Air Force Airborne Corps SOF.</strong> The PLAAF Airborne Corps, created in
          2011, train to conduct high-altitude, high-opening and high-altitude, low-opening
          airborne missions for critical target seizure, combat search and rescue, and fire
          support coordination during extraction.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>PLA Rocket Force Reconnaissance Regiment.</strong> The PLARF Reconnaissance
          Regiment which is based in Qinghai, can conduct air, land, and sea missions including
          counter-ISR, strategic asset protection, special reconnaissance, and target
          acquisition.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>People’s Armed Police SOF.</strong> The PAP has three main SOF units assigned to
          the two mobile contingents and the Xinjiang Military District. The Mountain Eagle
          Commando Unit created in 2019 and based in Xinjiang is trained to conduct
          counterterrorism missions within the province. The other two PAP SOF units, the Snow
          Leopards Commando Unit and the Falcon Commando Unit, are large rapid reaction forces
          with mixed capabilities that can be deployed in major contingencies on a national
          level. These units are also trained to conduct counterterrorism missions along with
          hostage rescue, and include assault, reconnaissance, explosive ordnance disposal, and
          sniper teams. The Snow Leopards have strict selection standards with a 40-50 percent of
          recruits failing the initial screening. The Snow Leopards’ annual “Devil Week” training
          simulates counterterrorism missions in multiple combat environments including desert,
          jungle, urban terrain, air, and sea.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Personnel.</strong> The PRC’s SOF currently has between 20,000 and 30,000
          personnel. The PRC’s SOF units are comprised of experienced officers and
          non-commissioned officers but are also assigned new conscripts and officers that
          recently graduated from basic training or military academy, including the Special
          Operations Academy in Guangzhou. SOF conscripts are selected from volunteers
          suggesting they are among the most qualified that commit to a two-year term of
          service. After their two-year commitment, the conscripts are offered to continue
          service as noncommissioned officers.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Structure and Organization.</strong> Beginning in January 2016, the PLA underwent
          several reforms that impacted the PLA SOF. The seven military regions were reorganized
          into five theater commands (TC) and five of the 18 GA were deactivated. The PLA SOF
          were also reorganized assigning a SOF BDE to each GA along with a SOF BDE for the
          Xinjiang and Tibet Military Districts. These and later reforms also impacted the PLARF
          Reconnaissance Regiment, the PLAAF Airborne Corps SOF BDE, and the PAP SOF units. Some
          of these SOF units are relatively new and were created using conventional forces to
          expand the PLA’s SOF capability. All PLA SOF units are supported by the PLA Air
          Force’s 15th Airborne Corps for tactical insertion, extraction, and resupply.
        </p>

        <p>
          Each PLA SOF BDE has between 2,000 and 3,000 personnel while a regiment has between
          1,000 and 2,000 personnel. While PLA SOF units have discrete missions based on branch
          and location, their internal structure resembles the PLA Army brigade-battalioncompany-team construct with a main, reserve, and rear command structure.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are three SOF units within the PAP which have a total of six detachments. Three
          detachments are assigned to the 1st Mobile Contingent based in Beijing, two
          detachments are assigned to the 2nd Mobile Contingent based in Guangzhou, and one
          detachment falls under the Xinjiang Internal Contingent.
        </p>

        <p>
          There is no national-level special operations command responsible for all SOF
          activities. PLA SOF also does not have organic or dedicated infrastructure or support
          and therefore must rely on conventional forces to support their missions whereas the
          PAP does have an internal logistic support system to support its SOF missions.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Internal Training and Exercises.</strong> The PRC’s SOF focus on individual and
          squad-level training; however, they have participated in larger combined arms and joint
          exercises. SOF training entails physical fitness training, close quarters combat,
          individual and team survival, camouflage, weapons proficiency, land navigation, and
          communication. All PRC SOF units are airborne and air assault capable.
        </p>

        <p>
          The recent reforms under Xi gave theater commanders authority over a wider range of
          forces including PLA SOF and also emphasized joint training. However, these reforms did
          not create joint task forces which might encourage increased coordination between the
          services. The restructuring to theater commands has not resulted in increased
          integration of PLA SOF into joint training. There is scant evidence of PRC’s SOF units
          from different services training together or with conventional forces, the exception
          being PLAAF aircraft for PLAA SOF airborne training. There is also no evidence that PAP
          SOF units have participated in joint exercises with any PLA forces. Theater commanders
          have no authority over PAP units, making it difficult to incorporate PAP SOF into PLA
          training exercises.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>External Training and Exercises.</strong> In 2002, the PLA began participating
          in multinational training exercises and since then, PRC’s SOF personnel and units, to
          include PAP SOF, have taken part in several foreign events, primarily focused on
          counterterrorism. Some of these events were held with units from Belarus, India,
          Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Mongolia, Russia, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Jordan.
          Individual PLA SOF personnel and small units have participated in training in Israel,
          Turkey, Estonia, Colombia, and Venezuela In August 2021, PLA SOF participated in joint
          training exercise “Zapad” with their Russian counterparts to help maintain security and
          stability in the Transbaikal region. Supported by Y-20 transport aircraft, PLA SOF
          focused their training on large-scale airborne exercises including heavy equipment
          insertion. Of note, the PAP’s Snow Leopards have won the International Warrior
          Competition held at Jordan’s King Abdullah II Special Operations Training Centre in
          Amman several times.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Equipment and Sustainment.</strong> The PRC’s SOF units are equipped with the
          most modern domestically-produced weapons and equipment. These include advanced
          communication and electronics, unmanned aerial systems ranging from micro-UAVs to the
          medium-altitude long endurance platforms, night vision devices, targeting devices,
          parachutes, and light vehicles, boats, and aircraft. PLA SOF units tasked with
          conducting clandestine maritime missions are also equipped with diver navigation aids,
          radios, undersea sensors, diver propulsion systems, underwater personnel delivery
          systems, and handheld direction-finding sonars for low-visibility underwater
          environments.
        </p>

        <p>
          PLA SOF do not have an internal support system to conduct missions and relies on the
          theater command to meet their logistical needs whereas the PAP has an internal logistic
          system separate from the PLA to meet their sustainment needs during operations.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Operational Capabilities.</strong> Most PLA ground SOF units appear to be elite
          light infantry units that can be inserted behind enemy lines but are limited by their
          conventional force counterpart’s ability to support their mission. PLA SOF brigades
          emphasize a “centralized command style”—common in conventional units—as opposed to a
          more flexible “task-oriented command style” via radio and satellite communications. PLA
          Army SOF brigades also include liaison officers from pertinent PLA Navy, Air Force,
          Rocket Force, and aviation units in their command post to facilitate SOF missions in
          support of theater command operations. PLA SOF brigades also face the same C2 issues
          that conventional PLA brigades encounter. One example from 2019 showed that voice
          communications were difficult to maintain using single-function and limited bandwidth
          radios and satellite communications terminals. This limited communication between the
          brigade and below conventional forces as well as the supporting SOF battalion and below
          forces.
        </p>

        <p>
          Many U.S. SOF activities do not fall within the purview of China’s SOF missions. PLA
          SOF do not conduct military information support operations (also known as psychological
          operations). These operations are conducted by elements within the PLA Political
          Department System. However, PLA SOF units may assist in larger information support
          operations, but would not be in command. PLA SOF also do not have units equivalent to
          U.S. Army Civil Affairs units.
        </p>

        <p>
          Humanitarian aid and disaster relief (HADR) is a mission conducted by all PLA, PAP, and
          militia units in conjunction with local civilian authorities. The PRC’s SOF may
          provide support in the form of communications and reconnaissance in remote areas, but
          would not be the lead agency for HADR missions.
        </p>

        <p>
          Both the PLAA and PLAAF lack aviation assets to conduct long-range insertions of PLA
          SOF to conduct strategic-level direct action or reconnaissance, but they can conduct air
          insertions of SOF in support of theater operations. Helicopters are used to transport
          SOF for airborne and air assault missions. All PLA airborne-qualified SOF train in
          fixed-wing aircraft, such as the Yun-5 biplane, which can also be used for SOF
          missions. However, the PLA’s shortage of long-range, heavy transport aircraft means PLA
          Air Force units receive priority to use these aircraft for airborne training.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Employment.</strong> Since 2008, approximately 70 PLANMC SOF personnel have
          deployed to the Gulf of Aden aboard PLAN vessels as part of the PRC’s counterpiracy
          operations. In 2015, PLA SOF conducted search and rescue, medical evacuation, and force
          protection operations in Nepal following an earthquake. Also in 2015, PLANMC SOF
          helped evacuate foreign nationals due to the war in Yemen and in 2017, PLANMC SOF
          recaptured a hijacked freighter from Somali pirates in the Gulf of Aden. In 2020, PLA
          SOF from the Tibet Military Region deployed to the border with India following clashes
          between Chinese and Indian forces along the LAC.

        <h2>JOINT CAPABILITIES IN DEVELOPMENT</h2>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The PLA is aggressively developing capabilities to provide options for the PRC to
            dissuade, deter, or, if ordered, defeat third-party intervention in the Indo-Pacific
            region.
          </li>
          <li>
            The PLA continues developing the capabilities to conduct military operations deeper
            into the Indo-Pacific region and globally.
          </li>
          <li>
            The PLA has undertaken important structural reforms and introduced new military
            doctrine to strengthen joint operations and is testing joint capabilities in and
            beyond the FIC.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Underground Facilities</h3>
        <p>
          The PLA maintains a robust and technologically advanced underground facility (UGF)
          program to conceal and protect all aspects of its military forces, including C2,
          weapons of mass destruction, logistics, and modernized missile, ground, air, and naval
          forces. The PRC has thousands of UGFs and constructs more each year. These UGFs are
          central to The PRC’s counter-intervention and power projection efforts, enabling the
          PLA to protect valuable assets from the effects of missile strikes and to conceal
          military operations from adversaries. The PRC’s emphasis on strategic deterrence has
          also contributed to the construction of UGFs for the country’s nuclear forces, which
          aims to survive an initial nuclear first-strike by an adversary.
        </p>

        <p>
          The PRC began to update and expand its military UGF program in the mid- to late-1980s.
          This modernization effort took on renewed urgency following the PRC’s observation of
          U.S. and Coalition air operations during the 1991 Gulf War and their use in OPERATION
          ALLIED FORCE. These military campaigns convinced China it needs to build more
          survivable, deeply buried facilities to protect military assets from the effects of
          penetrating conventional munition and nuclear strikes. Since the 2015-2016 military
          reforms, the PRC has expanded their UGF program to support survivable and redundant
          nodes for its wartime contingency planning. These nodes aim to enable continuous C2,
          communications, sustainment, and counterstrike capabilities across all PLA services and
          domains, as well as its joint forces. The PRC will likely continue to develop and expand
          its UGF program to support its expanding forces and military modernization.
        </p>

        <h3>Joint Capabilities for Counterintervention</h3>
        <p>
          The PRC’s counter-intervention strategy aims to restrict the United States from having
          a presence in the PRC’s immediate periphery and limit U.S. access in the broader
          Indo-Pacific region. The PLA’s A2/AD—otherwise known as “counterintervention”—
          capabilities are, to date, the most robust within the FIC, although the PLA is
          increasingly able to project power into the Philippine Sea and the PRC seeks to
          strengthen its capabilities to reach farther into the Pacific Ocean.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Long-Range Precision Strike and Supporting ISR.</strong> PLA texts state that
          precision attack in all warfare domains is critical in modern war. The PLA further
          notes that small elite forces using advanced weapons or capabilities can attain
          military effects that previously required large armies and much higher levels of damage
          and cost. Therefore, PLA writings state that precision weapons are not only force
          multipliers, but also a means of “war control” to prevent escalation. PLA documents
          further state that the range of vital political, economic, and military targets has
          grown as the advanced globalized economy develops, implying that growing PLA strike
          capabilities will attack an increasing array of targets, and, thereby, attain
          international strategic effects by striking critical nodes of the global economy during
          a future conflict.
        </p>

        <p>
          The PRC’s military modernization efforts have rapidly transformed the PLA’s missile
          force. The force is increasingly capable of conducting strikes against regional air
          bases, logistics and port facilities, communications, and other ground-based
          infrastructure—targets that PLA writings discuss as adversary vulnerabilities. The PLA
          is capable of reaching U.S. bases in Guam with ballistic and cruise missiles. In the
          future, PLA LACMs will also likely be deployable on surface platforms like the RENHAIclass guided-missile cruisers. H-6K bomber flights into the Philippine Sea demonstrate the
          PRC’s ability to range Guam with air-launched LACMs. The DF-26 intermediate range
          ballistic missile is a capable of ranging Guam and is capable of conducting nuclear,
          precision conventional, and maritime attacks.
        </p>

        <p>
          The PRC views its ability to acquire timely, high-fidelity information as critical to
          its ability to execute precision strikes. The PLA’s information support system for
          precision strikes depends heavily on Strategic Support Force (SSF) assets to detect,
          identify, target, and conduct battlefield damage assessments. The PRC emphasizes the
          importance of space-based surveillance capabilities in supporting precision strikes and,
          in 2022, continued to develop its constellation of military reconnaissance satellites
          that could support monitoring, tracking, and targeting of U.S. and allied forces. The
          PRC is also investing in reconnaissance, surveillance, command, control, and
          communications systems at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels to provide
          high-fidelity OTH targeting information for its strike platforms.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Integrated Air Defense System (IADS).</strong> The PRC has a robust and redundant
          IADS architecture over land areas and within 300 nm (556 km) of its coast that relies
          on an extensive early warning radar network, fighter aircraft, and a variety of SAM
          systems. The PRC has also placed radars and air defense weapons on outposts in the SCS,
          further extending the range of its IADS. It also employs point defenses, primarily to
          defend strategic targets against adversary long-range cruise missiles and airborne
          strike platforms.
        </p>

        <p>
          The PLA has increasing numbers of advanced long-range SAMs, including its indigenous
          CSA-9 (HQ-9) and its follow-on HQ-9B, Russian SA-10 (S-300PMU), and SA-20
          (S-300PMU1/PMU2), all of which have the advertised capability to protect against both
          aircraft and low-flying cruise missiles. To improve its strategic air defenses, the PLA
          possesses Russian-built SA-21 (S-400) Triumf SAM systems as a follow-on to the SA-20.
          Compared to these other systems, the SA-21 systems possess a longer maximum range,
          improved missile seekers, and more sophisticated radars.
        </p>

        <p>
          The PRC manufactures a variety of long-range air surveillance radars, including models
          claiming to support BMD and other models asserting the ability to detect stealth
          aircraft. Marketing materials also emphasize these systems’ ability to counter
          long-range airborne strike and combat support aircraft. PLAAF AEW&amp;C aircraft such
          as the KJ-2000 and KJ-500 can further extend the PRC’s radar coverage well past the
          range of its ground-based radars.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Ballistic and Cruise Missile Defense.</strong> The PLA’s long-range SAM inventory
          also offers a limited capability against ballistic missiles. The PRC’s domestic
          CSA-9 (HQ-9) long-range SAM system likely has a limited capability to provide point
          defense against tactical ballistic missiles. The PLA has SA-20 (S-300 PMU2) SAMs and
          SA-21 (S-400) SAMs that may have some capability to engage ballistic missiles,
          depending on the interceptors and supporting infrastructure. The PRC is working to
          develop BMD systems consisting of exo-atmospheric and endo-atmospheric kinetic-energy
          interceptors. The PRC is pursuing a mid-course interceptor that may have capabilities
          against IRBMs and possibly ICBMs. The PLA’s cruise missile defense capability is more
          robust than that of its ballistic missile defenses, with short-to-medium range SAMs,
          such as the HQ-22, augmenting the PLA’s long-range SAMs in this role.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Hypersonic Weapons.</strong> The PRC’s deployment of the DF-17 HGV-armed MRBM
          will continue to transform the PLA’s missile force. The system, fielded in 2020, is
          possibly intended to replace some older SRBM units, according to PRC media, and is
          intended to strike foreign military bases and fleets in the Western Pacific, according
          to a PRC-based military expert.
        </p>

          <strong>Key Takeaways</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The PLA continues to increase its military capabilities to achieve China’s regional
            and global security objectives beyond its immediate periphery.
          </li>
          <li>
            The PLA has emphasized primarily power projection capabilities in the maritime
            domain, while its joint operational capabilities beyond the FIC remains limited.
          </li>
          <li>
            Improvements of PLA air and naval systems are enabling PLA forces to operate further

          PLA ground, naval, air and rocket forces are increasingly capable of projecting power
          at greater distances from China. However, joint service training is still in its infancy
          and the PLA has demonstrated limited joint operational capabilities beyond the FIC.
          Instead, overseas activities are mostly conducted by single services and do not involve
          combat. In early 2022, the Southern Theater Command Navy conducted a joint distant sea
          training, where personnel from the Navy, Air Force, and Rocket Force served in the
          joint operations command system.

          <strong>PLAN Operational Experience.</strong> The PLAN’s experience in extended range
          operations is primarily derived from naval task group deployments and its ongoing
          counterpiracy mission in the Gulf of Aden, humanitarian and disaster relief operations,
          or intelligence collection missions. However, the PLA does also deploy surface task
          groups into areas of the western and southern Pacific to gain incremental far seas
          experience.

            The PLAN has operated in the Gulf of Aden since 2008, deploying 3-4 vessels on
            average and 700 personnel for 4-month deployments. As of January 2023, the PLA has
            deployed 131 vessels and more than 32,000 personnel across 42 escort missions.

            In early 2022, the PLAN conducted distant sea joint training in the eastern Indian
            and western Pacific oceans. The task group included two destroyers, an amphibious
            landing dock, and a replenishment ship.

            In January and February 2022, the PLAN and PLAAF delivered disaster relief supplies
            to the Pacific Island nation Tonga.

            In March 2022, a PLA naval supply ship conducted resupply at the PLA’s Support Base
            in Djibouti, marking the first time a PLA vessel naval ships berthed at the location.

            In August 2022, a PLA AGI conducted an intelligence collection mission during the
            U.S. Navy’s international exercise RIMPAC.

            In September 2022, the PLA conducted a four-day maritime training exercise with
            guided missile destroyers in the South Pacific, near French Polynesia.

          <strong>PLAN Platforms.</strong> New ships enable the PLAN to gradually extend its
          operational reach beyond East Asia. In 2022, the PLAN launched its third aircraft
          carrier, Fujian, equipped with electromagnetic catapults, capable of launching various
          fixed-wing aircraft. When commissioned, the carrier will be capable of launching
          various specialized fixed-wing aircraft for early warning, electronic warfare, or
          anti-submarine warfare missions, increasing the strike power potential of the PLAN.

          The RENHAI and LUYANG III are the PRC’s premier carrier escort for blue-water
          operations. The RENHAI CG, with 13,000 tons displacement and long-range ASCMs and SAMs,
          will likely be equipped with a planned naval variant of the Z-20 helicopter. The PLAN
          is engaged in series production of the RENHAI CG with at least eight units in service.
          The PLAN currently operates eight YUCHAO-class amphibious assault ships (LPD) and
          commissioned its first of three YUSHEN-class helicopter assault ships (LHD) in April
          2021. The PLAN’s expanding fleet of large modern amphibious warships will enable it to
          conduct a wide range of expeditionary operations to protect the PRC’s interests or in
          support of international assistance operations.

          The PLAN is also expanding its logistical capabilities to support long-distance
          operations. The PLAN now has a sizable force of highly capable logistical replenishment
          ships to support long-duration deployments.

          The PLANMC continues to make strides towards becoming a multidimensional expeditionary
          force capable of conducting operations beyond the FIC to protect the PRC’s growing
          overseas interests. The PLANMC maintains a presence at the PRC’s first overseas
          military support facility in Djibouti, which the PRC refers to as its “PLA support base
          in Djibouti” (吉布提保障基地), that extends The PRC’s military reach and strategic
          influence in Africa and the Middle East. The PLANMC’s presence in Djibouti seeks to
          enable a military response to contingencies affecting the PRC’s investments and
          infrastructure in the region.

          <strong>Aviation Forces (PLAAF, PLAA Aviation, PLAN Aviation).</strong> PLA aviation
          forces are fielding advanced platforms capable of supporting future long-distance
          operations, as their mission sets evolve from defending Chinese territorial space to
          launching offensive operations at distances beyond the FIC. While interoperability is a
          stated priority, joint exercises between the aviation’s forces are limited.
          Individually, the PLAAF, PLAN Aviation, and PLAA Aviation continue to improve their
          capabilities to conduct offensive and defensive operations offshore, including strike,
          air and missile defense, strategic mobility, early warning and reconnaissance missions,
          and insertion. The PLAAF, in particular, has received repeated calls from its
          leadership to become a truly “strategic” air force, able to project power at long
          distances to advance and defend the PRC’s global interests.

            The PLA’s indigenously developed Y-20A heavy-lift transport has performed numerous
            overseas missions, including an April 2022 arms delivery to Serbia. Y-20A aircraft
            have delivered humanitarian aid throughout Asia, Africa, Europe, the Middle East and
            the South Pacific. In 2021, the Y-20U tanker entered service, supporting the continued
            PLAAF expansion of air refuelable fighters, bombers, and SMA aircraft. These new air
            refuelable aircraft will significantly expand the PRC’s ability to conduct
            long-range offensive air operations. In addition to aerial refueling, it is expected
            that there will likely be further Y-20 variants, such as a possible AWAC variant.
