          <strong>COVID-19 mitigation measures and multiple outbreaks throughout 2022 probably did not
          significantly impact PLA combat readiness, judging from the PLA’s December 2022
          skirmishes with Indian forces near Tawang along the LAC and other deployments.</strong>{' '}
          While some non-combat programs like the PLA’s annual spring recruitment program were 
          delayed, the PLA’s mitigation efforts probably were successful in limiting COVID-19

          The PRC has stated its defense policy aims to safeguard its national sovereignty, security, 
          and development interests. CCP leaders view these interests as foundational to their 
          national strategy. The modernization of the armed forces is an indispensable element of 
          the Party’s national strategy to modernize the country. At the Fifth Plenum in October 2020, 
          the CCP declared the PRC’s ambitions for becoming a rich country are closely integrated with 
          its ambitions to develop a powerful military. The PRC’s defense policy and military strategy 
          primarily orients the PLA toward “safeguarding” its perceived “sovereignty and security” 
          interests in the region while countering the United States. At the same time, CCP leaders 
          increasingly cast the armed forces as a practical instrument to defend the PRC’s expanding 
          global interests and to advance its foreign policy goals within the framework of “Great 
          Power Diplomacy with Chinese Characteristics.”
        </p>

        <p>
          Xi’s work report to the 20th Party Congress in October 2022 said that the People’s Liberation 
          Army must move quicker with troop training and new strategies to reach its target of becoming 
          a world-class military. The PRC’s military strategy is based on “active defense,” a concept 
          that adopts the principles of strategic defense in combination with offensive action at the 
          operational and tactical levels. To adapt the PRC’s armed forces to long-term trends in global 
          military affairs and meet the country’s evolving national security needs, PRC leaders stress 
          the imperative of meeting key military transformation targets set for 2027 and 2035. These 
          milestones seek to align the PLA’s transformation with the PRC’s overall national modernization 
          so that by the end of 2049, the PRC will field a “world-class” military.
        </p>

        <h3>Strategic Assessment</h3>
        <p>
          A key driver of the PRC’s defense policy is how the CCP leaders perceive the relative threats 
          and opportunities facing the country’s comprehensive national development. During Chairman 
          Xi’s CCP centenary speech, he called for the full implementation of the Party’s idea of 
          strengthening the army in the new era. The last defense white paper, <em>China’s National 
          Defense in the New Era</em>, published in 2019, reaffirmed that China’s armed forces are 
          aligned with and contribute to the strategies of the CCP, stating that ongoing military 
          reforms “ensure absolute leadership of the CCP over the military.” According to the paper, 
          Beijing views the international environment as undergoing “profound changes unseen in a 
          century.” The CCP concludes that “international strategic competition is on the rise” and 
          expresses deep concerns at what it sees as growing sources of instability in the near-term. 
          Beijing offers no introspection on its role in stirring geopolitical tensions through its 
          economic practices, military activities and modernization, excessive maritime territorial 
          claims, assertive diplomacy, or efforts to revise aspects of global governance. Rather, the 
          PRC describes the international system as being “…undermined by growing hegemonism, power 
          politics, unilateralism and constant regional conflicts and wars.” Similarly, the PRC contends 
          that global military competition is intensifying and that “major countries” are adjusting 
          their security and military strategies, reorganizing their militaries, and are developing 
          new types of combat forces to “seize the strategic commanding heights in military competition.”
        </p>

        <h3>Defense Policy</h3>
        <p>
          The PRC’s stated defense policy is to “resolutely safeguard” its sovereignty, security, and 
          development interests, according to its 2019 defense white paper, which provides continuity 
          with past statements by PRC senior leaders and other official documents. Xi’s work report to 
          the 20th Party Congress reiterated this policy, saying that fast modernization of the PLA’s 
          organization, personnel, and military technology standards, under the absolute leadership of 
          the party, would be key not only to defending China’s sovereignty but also its security and 
          developmental interests. In practice, the PRC’s military power is increasingly a central 
          feature of the CCP’s regional and global ambitions. The 2019 defense white paper also 
          identifies the PRC’s national defense aims that support these interests, in likely order of 
          importance:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>to deter and resist aggression;</li>
          <li>to safeguard national political security, the people’s security, and social stability;</li>
          <li>to oppose and contain “Taiwan independence;”</li>
          <li>to crack down on proponents of separatist movements such as “Tibet independence” 
              and the creation of “East Turkistan;”</li>
          <li>to safeguard national sovereignty, unity, territorial integrity, and security;</li>
          <li>to safeguard the PRC’s maritime rights and interests;</li>
          <li>to safeguard the PRC’s security interests in outer space, the electromagnetic spectrum, 
              and cyberspace;</li>
          <li>to safeguard the PRC’s overseas interests; and</li>
          <li>to support the sustainable development of the country.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Key changes in defense policy for the “New Era” include efforts to improve coordination 
          across the party-state to leverage all organs of national power in a unified approach to 
          support the CCP’s ambitions of a global military capability. Unlike previous defense white 
          papers, <em>China’s National Defense in the New Era</em> explicitly stressed the PRC’s armed 
          forces’ alignment and support to the Party’s broader societal and foreign policy objectives. 
          For example, the white paper states that the PRC’s armed forces must be ready to “provide 
          strong strategic support for the realization of the Chinese Dream of national rejuvenation, 
          and to make new and greater contributions to the building of a shared future for mankind.” 
          Also notable is the explicit alignment between the PRC’s defense and foreign policies, 
          particularly in the armed forces’ role in protecting the PRC’s overseas interests and 
          furthering the CCP’s concept of “strategic partnerships” with other countries.
        </p>

        <h3>Military Strategic Guidelines (军事战略方针)</h3>
        <p>
          The Chairman of the CMC issues military strategic guidelines to the PLA that provide the 
          foundation of the PRC’s military strategy. The military strategic guidelines set the general 
          principles and concepts for the use of force in support of the CCP’s strategic objectives, 
          provide guidance on the threats and conditions the armed forces should be prepared to face, 
          and set priorities for planning, modernization, force structure, and readiness. The CCP 
          leadership issues new military strategic guidelines, or adjusts existing guidelines, whenever 
          they perceive it necessary to shift the PLA’s priorities based on the Party’s perceptions 
          of China’s security environment or changes in the character of warfare.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since 2019, trends indicate the PRC has reviewed and adjusted its military strategic 
          guidelines. In early 2019, PRC state media indicated that Beijing held senior-level meetings 
          to “establish the military strategy of the ‘New Era.’” The PRC’s 2019 defense white paper 
          states that the PLA is implementing guidelines for the “New Era” that “…actively adapt to 
          the new landscape of strategic competition, the new demands of national security, and new 
          developments in modern warfare…” PRC official media in the latter half of 2019 echoed these 
          themes and described the guidelines as constituting a notable change. The PRC’s defense 
          white paper may reflect changes in the guidelines given its emphasis on the intensification 
          of global military competition, the increase in the pace of technological change, and the 
          military modernization themes introduced by General Secretary Xi at the 19th Party Congress. 
          Documents released following the Fifth Plenum of the 19th Central Committee in October 2020 
          hailed progress in the “comprehensive and in-depth” implementation of the “New Era military 
          strategic guidelines.”
        </p>

        <p>
          These developments are notable because the CCP leadership has issued new military strategic 
          guidelines or adjusted its guidelines only a few times since the end of the Cold War. In 
          1993, the CMC under Jiang Zemin directed the PLA to prepare to win “local wars” under 
          “high-tech conditions” after observing U.S. military operations in the Gulf War. In 2004, 
          the CMC under Hu Jintao ordered the military to focus on winning “local wars under 
          informationized conditions.” In 2014, the CMC placed greater focus on conflicts in the 
          maritime domain and fighting “informatized local wars.”
        </p>

        <h3>Military Strategy — Active Defense</h3>
        <p>
          The PRC’s military strategy is based on what it describes as “active defense,” a concept 
          that adopts the principles of strategic defense in combination with offensive action at the 
          operational and tactical levels. Active defense is neither a purely defensive strategy nor 
          limited to territorial defense. Active defense encompasses offensive and preemptive aspects. 
          It can apply to the PRC acting externally to defend its interests. Active defense is rooted 
          in the principle of avoiding initiating armed conflict but responding forcefully if 
          challenged. The PRC’s 2019 defense white paper reaffirmed active defense as the basis for 
          its military strategy. Minister of National Defense General Wei Fenghe reiterated this 
          principle of active defense in his speech at the Ninth Beijing Xiangshan Forum in 2019, 
          stating that the PRC “will not attack unless we are attacked, but will surely counterattack 
          if attacked.”
        </p>

        <p>
          First adopted by the CCP in the 1930s, active defense has served as the basis for the PRC’s 
          military strategy since its founding in 1949. Although the PRC has adjusted and tailored the 
          specifics of active defense over time based on changes in strategic circumstances, its general 
          principles have remained consistent. Contemporary PRC writings describe the tenets of active 
          defense as:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Adhere to a position of self-defense and stay with striking back.</strong> This 
            describes the basic principle for the use of military force under active defense. The 
            PRC’s 2019 defense white paper describes this principle as, “We will not attack unless 
            we are attacked, but we will surely counterattack if attacked.” Active defense may 
            entail defensive counterattacks in response to an attack or preemptively striking an 
            adversary that the PRC judges is preparing to attack.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Combine strategic defense with operational and tactical offense.</strong> This 
            aspect offers two approaches to warfare influenced by Mao Zedong’s notion of using 
            defense and offense in turns. First, active defense may involve offensive campaigns, 
            operations, and tactical actions in support of the strategic defense. These may occur 
            rapidly and along “external lines.” Second, it uses strategic defense to weaken the 
            enemy and set the conditions to transition into strategic offense in order to secure 
            victory. Strategic defense is not equivalent to deterrence but includes deterrence. 
            Strategic defense also includes actions taken after deterrence has failed, such as 
            conducting conventional strikes against an adversary.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Taking the operational initiative.</strong> This aspect emphasizes the effective 
            use of offensives at the operational and tactical levels, avoiding enemy strengths, 
            and concentrating on building asymmetric advantages against enemy weaknesses to 
            “change what is inferior into what is superior.”
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Strive for the best possibilities.</strong> This calls for thorough peacetime 
            military preparations and planning based on fighting the most challenging threat 
            under the most complicated circumstances “in order to get the best results.” This 
            aspect stresses the importance of setting conditions in advance and suggests it is 
            preferable to be prepared and not fight, than to fight unprepared.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The dialectical unity of restraining war and winning war.</strong> This tenet 
            seeks to resolve the dilemma that using too little force may protract a war instead of 
            stopping it while the unconstrained use of force may worsen a war and make it harder 
            to stop. Calling for the “effective restraint of warfare,” this tenet seeks to avoid 
            war first through sufficient military preparations and powerful conventional and 
            strategic forces that act in concert with political and diplomatic efforts to “subdue 
            the enemy’s troops without fighting.” If war is unavoidable, however, this aspect 
            calls for restraining war by taking the “opening move” and “using war to stop war.”
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Soldiers and the people are the source of victory.</strong> This integrates the 
            concept of active defense with the concept of “people’s war.” People’s war comprises 
            subordinate military strategies, “guerrilla war” and “protracted war,” that Mao saw 
            as a means to harness the capacity of China’s populace as a source of political 
            legitimacy and mobilization to generate military power. Contemporary PRC writings 
            link “people’s war” to national mobilization and participation in wartime as a 
            whole-of-nation concept of warfare.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <strong>Military Missions and Tasks.</strong> The CMC directs the PLA to be ready and able 
          to perform specific missions and tasks to support the Party’s strategy and defend the 
          PRC’s sovereignty, security, and development interests. The PLA’s missions and tasks in 
          the “New Era” include safeguarding China’s territorial sovereignty and maritime rights 
          and interests, maintaining combat readiness, conducting military training under real 
          combat conditions, safeguarding China’s nuclear weapons and its interests in the space 
          and cyberspace domains, countering terrorism and maintaining stability, protecting the 
          PRC’s overseas interests, and participating in emergency response and disaster relief.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Modernization Objectives and Targets.</strong> In his speech at the 20th Party Congress, 
          Xi detailed PLA goals of enhancing party loyalty in the military, while simultaneously 
          strengthening the military through reform, science and technology, personnel training, 
          mechanization, informatization, and modernized military strategies.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 2020, the PLA added a new milestone for modernization in 2027, to accelerate the 
          integrated development of mechanization, informatization, and intelligentization of 
          the PRC’s armed forces, which if realized could give the PLA capabilities to be a more 
          credible military tool for the CCP’s Taiwan unification efforts. The PLA’s 2027 
          modernization goal aligns with the 100th anniversary of the PLA’s founding. During his 
          October 2022 speech at the opening ceremony of the 20th Party Congress, Xi said that 
          China intends to complete the plan to modernize the PLA by 2027. In a March 2021 speech, 
          Xi detailed that the 2027 modernization goal is the first step in a broader modernization 
          effort. PLA writings note the “three-step” modernization plan connects “near-, medium-, 
          and long-term goals in 2027, 2035, and 2049” respectively.
        </p>

        <p>
          The PRC’s goals for modernizing its armed forces in the “New Era” are as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>By 2027:</strong> “Accelerate the integrated development of mechanization, 
            informatization, and intelligentization,” while boosting the speed of modernization 
            in military theories, organizations, personnel, and weapons and equipment.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>By 2035:</strong> “To comprehensively advance the modernization of military 
            theory, organizational structure, military personnel, and weaponry and equipment in 
            step with the modernization of the country and basically complete the modernization 
            of national defense and the military…”
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>By 2049:</strong> “To fully transform the people’s armed forces into world-class 
            forces.”
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The 5th Plenum communique holds that the 2027 goal means that the Chinese military should 
          comprehensively push forward the modernization of military theories, military organizational 
          form, military personnel, and weapons and equipment. PRC media, citing a military source, 
          connected the PLA’s 2027 goals to developing the capabilities to counter the U.S. military 
          in the Indo-Pacific region, and compel Taiwan’s leadership to the negotiation table on the 
          PRC’s terms.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Military Ambitions.</strong> The CCP has not defined what it means by its ambition to 
          have a “world-class” military by the end of 2049. Within the context of China’s national 
          strategy, however, it is likely that the PRC will seek to develop a military by mid-century 
          that is equal to—or, in some cases, superior to—the U.S. military, and that of any other 
          great power that Beijing views as a threat to its sovereignty, security, and development 
          interests. Given the far-reaching ambitions the CCP has for a rejuvenated China, it is 
          unlikely that the Party would aim for an end state in which the PRC would remain in a 
          position of military inferiority vis-à-vis the United States or any other potential rival. 
          However, this does not mean that the PRC will aim for the PLA to mirror the U.S. military 
          in terms of capacity, capability, or readiness. The PRC will likely seek to develop its 
          “world-class” military in a manner that it believes best suits the needs of its armed 
          forces to defend and advance the country’s interests and how the PLA—guided by the Party—
          adapts to the changing character of warfare.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Way of War.</strong> The PLA increasingly views warfare as a confrontation between 
          opposing operational systems, rather than a war of annihilation between opposing mechanized 
          military forces. Following this logic, PLA writings refer to <em>systems destruction warfare 
          (体系破击战)</em> as the next way of war, transforming from mechanized warfare to an 
          informatized and intelligentized style warfare. Although not a new PLA approach, systems 
          destruction warfare likely continues to be the principal theory guiding its way of war.
        </p>

        <p>
          In November 2020, the CMC announced that it had issued the “Chinese People's Liberation Army 
          Joint Operations Outline (Trial).” The Outline establishes a system for the PLA’s joint 
          operations and focuses on clarifying basic issues regarding the organization and 
          implementation of joint operations, command rights and responsibilities, and the principles, 
          requirements, and procedures for joint operations, combat support, national defense 
          mobilization, and political work. According to PLA writings, the Outline describes how the 
          future combat style of the PLA will be integrated joint operations under the unified command 
          of a joint operations command system. PLA writers emphasized that winning future wars would 
          require a high degree of joint integration of various combat forces and combat elements 
          from across the PLA services and other arms and across all domains, with jointness 
          deepened at the operational and tactical levels. PLA writings highlight the multi-domain 
          component of integrated joint operations and the need to coordinate the development of 
          “mechanization, informatization, and intelligentization integration.” The PLA’s 
          “operational regulations” were last updated in 1999 and PLA leaders and PLA-affiliated 
          academics have pointed to the lack of updated doctrine, which is out of step with the 
          2015-era structural command and organizational reforms, and an obstacle to advancing the 
          next steps in building a unified joint PLA.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since the CMC issued the Outline, the PLA has launched a force-wide effort to study and 
          implement it, including through joint operations undertaken during exercises. The PLA is 
          working to turn the Outline’s vision of joint operations into reality by breaking down 
          institutional barriers and standardizing command systems in practice. Along the way, the 
          PLA seeks to identify shortcomings, develop solutions, and facilitate the adoption of 
          modern operational concepts.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Core Operational Concept.</strong> In 2021, the PLA began discussing a new 
          “core operational concept,” called “Multi-Domain Precision Warfare (多域精确战)” (MDPW). 
          MDPW is intended to leverage a C4ISR network that incorporates advances in big data and 
          artificial intelligence, what the PLA calls the “network information system-of-systems,” 
          to rapidly identify key vulnerabilities in the U.S. operational system and then combine 
          joint forces across domains to launch precision strikes against those vulnerabilities. 
          MDPW is meant to sit atop an “operational conceptual system-of-systems,” suggesting the 
          PLA will develop additional subordinate operational concepts and use simulations, war 
          games, and exercises to test, evaluate, and improve these future-oriented operational 
          concepts. The timing of MDPW’s appearance vis-à-vis China’s updated doctrine and military 
          strategic guidelines suggests that MDPW serves as a connection between them, likely 
          amplifying themes and guidance in both while focusing on the contours of what the PLA must 
          be able to do to win future wars.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Joint Firepower Strike.</strong> PLA writings have long emphasized the importance of 
          joint firepower strikes as a component of large-scale operations. Joint firepower strikes 
          include multiple services combining to utilize their firepower capabilities to create 
          substantial effect and have been explicitly tied to a Taiwan invasion in PLA writings. During 
          the August 2022 Congressional Delegation (CODEL) visit to Taiwan, the PLA Rocket Force 
          fired multiple ballistic missiles into impact zones in waters around Taiwan; this included 
          at least four missiles that overflew Taiwan, which was unprecedented. The military drills 
          afforded the PLA an opportunity to train simulated joint firepower strike operations.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Readiness.</strong> Alongside modernizing the PLA’s capabilities and organizational 
          reform, PRC’s leaders have identified enhancing the combat readiness of the armed forces 
          as an important element in developing the PRC’s military strength. In recent years, Xi 
          and senior military leaders have continued to emphasize the need to build the PLA’s combat 
          readiness so it can “fight and win wars.” This emphasis has not only entailed the PLA 
          conducting more training but making its training more rigorous and realistic as well as 
          addressing issues in the PLA’s training and education systems relating to conducting complex 
          joint operations and adapting to other aspects of modern warfare. It probably has also led 
          to a standardization of a combat readiness system across the PLA to enable the PRC to 
          quickly transition to a wartime footing.
        </p>

        <p>
          Along with the CCP leadership’s focus on improving the PLA’s combat readiness, in recent 
          years PLA media outlets have noted shortcomings in the military’s training and education 
          systems that reportedly left some commanders—particularly at the operational level—
          inadequately prepared for modern warfare. In response to perceived personnel deficiencies 
          within the PLA, Xi approved and issued a new series of regulations in July 2022 regarding 
          the management of PLA soldiers seeking to improve recruiting, training, promotions, 
          benefits, and demobilization efforts for NCOs. In recent years, PLA media outlets have 
          identified the need for the military to address the “Five Incapables” problem: that some 
          commanders cannot (1) judge situations, (2) understand higher authorities’ intentions, 
          (3) make operational decisions, (4) deploy forces, and (5) manage unexpected situations.
          Although PLA writings do not specify how widespread the “Five Incapables” are, PLA media 
          outlets have consistently raised them. One outside expert has noted this may indicate the 
          PLA lacks confidence in its proficiency to execute its own operational concepts. 
          Additionally, senior Party and PLA leaders are keenly aware that the military has not 
          experienced combat in decades nor fought with its current suite of capabilities and 
          organizational structures. PLA leaders and state media frequently call on the force to 
          remedy the “peacetime disease” that manifests in the form of what it characterizes as 
          lax training attitudes and practices that are viewed as hindering combat readiness.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>COVID-19 mitigation measures and multiple outbreaks throughout 2022 probably did not
          significantly undermine PLA combat readiness, judging from the PLA’s December 2022
          skirmishes with Indian forces near Tawang along the LAC, and other deployments.</strong> 
          Although some non-combat programs like the PLA’s annual spring recruitment program were 
          delayed, the PLA’s mitigation efforts probably were successful in limiting COVID-19 
          outbreaks within China’s military.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Anti-Corruption Campaign.</strong> Anticorruption investigations in the PLA are a 
          component of a Party-wide effort that General Secretary Xi strengthened and accelerated 
          shortly after taking office. The stated goal of these campaigns is to safeguard the 
          legitimacy of the CCP, root out corruption, improve governance, and centralize Xi and the 
          Party’s authority. Military discipline inspectors led by the CMC Discipline Inspection 
          Commission have targeted individual power networks and occupational specialties historically 
          prone to corruption, such as officers connected to disgraced former CMC Vice Chairmen Xu 
          Caihou and Guo Boxiong, and former Chief of Joint Staff General Fang Fenghui. In 2022, 
          General Secretary Xi delivered a speech to the CCP Central Commission for Discipline 
          Inspection in which he stated that although serious potential dangers of corruption within 
          the Party and the military have been rooted out, the fight against corruption is still raging 
          in the PRC. In mid-2023, PRC media announced that PLA Rocket Force leadership was being 
          replaced and the PLA launched an inquiry into corruption linked to the procurement of 
          military equipment, indicating that the PLA’s anti-corruption campaign remains incomplete.
          Emblematic of Xi’s sustained focus on anti-corruption efforts in 2022, PRC authorities 
          continued frequent arrests of high-ranking officials and business elites for allegations 
          of taking bribes and abusing power, especially in the financial sector. In November 2022 
          alone, PRC authorities arrested the Vice Governor of the People’s Bank of China and former 
          CEO of a major PRC telecommunications firm as a result of investigations by CCP anti-corruption 
          bodies.

          <strong>Effects of COVID-19 on PLA Modernization and Reform Goals.</strong> In 2022, the 
          COVID-19 pandemic likely had little effect on the PLA’s modernization and reform goals. 
          At the 20th Party Congress in October, Xi continued to emphasize promoting the modernization 
          of China’s national defense and armed forces. A few months later, in his annual new year's 
          address, Xi highlighted military and strategic achievements from 2022 including the PLA’s 
          95th anniversary, the launching of the PLAN’s third aircraft carrier, and the completion 
          of China's space station. In 2022, the PLA continued to play a role in COVID-19 response 
          activity, such as mobilizing approximately 2,000 medical personnel to Shanghai during an 
          outbreak in April. The PRC’s recent Government Work Report referenced PLA activities through 
          the last year, including COVID-19 response that boosted China’s national defense mobilization 
          capability.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Party-Army Relations.</strong> The PLA is the principal armed wing of the CCP and, 
          as a Party-army, does not directly serve the state but rather is under the direct control 
          of the Party. The CCP CMC, currently chaired by Xi, is the highest military decision-making 
          body in the PRC. As a Party-army, the PLA is a political actor. As a constituency within 
          the Party, it participates in the PRC’s political and governance systems. As the ultimate 
          guarantor of the Party’s rule and the PRC’s government system, the PLA’s missions include 
          formal and informal domestic security missions in addition to its national defense missions. 
          Since becoming CMC Chairman, Xi has implemented multiple reforms which reduced PLA autonomy 
          and greatly strengthened Party control over the military. Party leaders and official 
          statements continue to emphasize the principles of the Party’s absolute control over the 
          PLA and the PLA’s loyalty to the Party.

        <h2>China’s Military Leadership</h2>
        <p>
          As the military’s highest decision-making body, the CMC is technically also a department 
          of the CCP Central Committee. The CMC Chairman is a civilian, usually serving concurrently 
          as the General Secretary of the CCP and President of the PRC. CMC members are appointed at 
          Party Congresses every five years. In the fall of 2022 at the 20th Party Congress, General 
          Zhang Youxia ascended to the first Vice Chairman position, joined by General He Weidong 
          as the second Vice Chairman. Other CMC members include General Li Shangfu, General Liu 
          Zhenli, and returning members Admiral Miao Hua and General Zhang Shengmin. In 2022, the 
          CMC consisted of two vice chairs, the Minister of National Defense, the chiefs of the Joint 
          Staff and Political Work Departments, and the head of the Discipline Inspection Commission.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Chairman Xi Jinping</strong> concurrently serves as the CCP General Secretary, CMC 
          Chairman, and President of the PRC. Xi was first appointed as Party General Secretary and 
          CMC Chairman in 2012 and as President in the spring of 2013. Xi was reappointed to all of 
          his positions for an unprecedented third term at 2022’s 20th Party Congress and the 2023 
          National People’s Congress. In 2016, Xi was announced as the commander-in-chief of the 
          CMC’s Joint Operations Command Center (JOCC) and was named “core” leader of the CCP Central 
          Committee. Prior to becoming CMC Chairman, Xi served as the CMC’s only civilian Vice 
          Chairman under Hu Jintao. Xi’s father was an important military figure during China’s 
          communist revolution and was a Politburo member in the 1980s. Xi also served as an aide 
          to a defense minister early in his career and had regular interactions with the PLA as a 
          provincial Party official.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Vice Chairman General Zhang Youxia</strong> is China’s top uniformed official and 
          former junior vice chairman. Zhang was first appointed to the CMC in 2012 as the head of 
          the General Armaments Department – now the Equipment Development Department (EDD) – where 
          he oversaw the PLA’s manned space program, as well as MCF and military modernization 
          efforts. Zhang gained rare experience as a combat commander during China’s brief war with 
          Vietnam in 1979. Zhang formerly commanded the Shenyang Military Region, which shares a 
          border with North Korea and Russia. Zhang is one of the PLA’s “princelings.” His father, a 
          well-known military figure in China, served with Xi’s father at the close of Chinese Civil 
          War in 1949. Zhang, at age 72 in 2022, was expected to retire due to previously followed 
          age norms within the PLA. However, Zhang’s retention on the CMC for a third term probably 
          reflects Xi’s desire to keep a close and experienced ally as his top military advisor.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Vice Chairman General He Weidong</strong> is China’s second-most senior officer and 
          a former commander of the PLA’s Eastern Theater. His ascent to a vice chairman position 
          absent prior CMC membership is unusual and probably a testament to his extensive operational 
          experience focused on Taiwan. Before his selection as vice chairman, He served a brief 
          stint in the CMC JOCC where he played a key role in planning live-fire drills in the Taiwan 
          Strait as part of the PLA response to the then-U.S. House Speaker Pelosi’s August 2022 
          visit to Taipei. He may have close ties to Xi due to their overlapping service in Fujian 
          and Zhejiang provinces in the late 1990s and early 2000s.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Minister of National Defense General Li Shangfu</strong> was appointed to the CMC 
          at the 20th Party Congress in October 2022, and as the Minister of National Defense at the 
          NPC in March 2023. Li is the PLA’s third-most senior officer and manages its relationship 
          with state bureaucracies and foreign militaries. Unlike the U.S. Secretary of Defense, he 
          is not part of the chain of command and his primary policy influence is derived from 
          membership on the CMC and State Council, where he serves as a direct liaison for civil-military 
          integration, defense mobilization, and budgeting. Li previously headed the EDD where he 
          managed the PLA’s weapons development and acquisition efforts and China’s manned space 
          program. In 2018, Li was sanctioned by the United States for his role as EDD director 
          overseeing the purchase of Russian fighter jets and surface-to-air missile systems.

          <strong>Joint Staff Department Chief General Liu Zhenli</strong> oversees PLA joint 
          operations, a narrowing of the wider responsibilities held by the former General Staff 
          Department prior to reforms initiated in 2015. Liu is one of few remaining active-duty 
          PLA officers with combat experience and is recognized as a combat hero for his service 
          in China’s border war with Vietnam. Like his predecessor Li Zuocheng, Liu rose through the 
          ranks of the PLA Army HQ, assuming command of the service in 2021. Beginning in 2015 as 
          Army chief of staff, Liu guided the service through a major period of reform which saw the 
          ground force downgraded to an equal standing with the other branches. Liu, at age 58 in 
          2022, is the youngest CMC member and is eligible to remain on the CMC for at least an 
          additional term.

        <p>
          <strong>Political Work Department Director Admiral Miao Hua</strong> oversees the PLA’s 
          political work, including propaganda, organization, and education. Miao is a former Army 
          officer who switched services to the Navy in December 2014 when he became political 
          commissar of the PLAN. Miao may have ties to Xi from his time serving in the 31st Group 
          Army in Fujian Province, when his career overlapped with Xi’s. Miao participated as the 
          PLAN political commissar during the Navy’s BRIcruise conducted in mid-2017. Miao Hua, at 
          age 66 in 2022, remained on the CMC in his current position following the 20th Party Congress.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Secretary of the Discipline Inspection Commission General Zhang Shengmin</strong> 
          oversees the highest-level organization responsible for investigating military violations 
          of Party discipline, including corrupt practices. Zhang is also a deputy secretary and 
          third-ranking member on the standing committee of the Party’s Discipline Inspection 
          Commission. Zhang’s reappointment reflects the Party’s continued commitment to the 
          anticorruption campaign within the military. Zhang, at age 65 in 2022, remained on the 
          CMC in his current position following the 20th Party Congress.

        <h2>CHAPTER TWO: PLA FORCES, CAPABILITIES, AND POWER PROJECTION</h2>
        <h3>KEY TAKEAWAYS</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The PLA has sought to modernize its capabilities and improve its proficiencies 
            across all warfare domains so that, as a joint force, it can conduct the full range 
            of land, air, and maritime as well as nuclear, space, counterspace, electronic 
            warfare (EW), and cyberspace operations.
          </li>
          <li>
            The PLA’s evolving capabilities and concepts continue to strengthen the PRC’s 
            ability to “fight and win wars” against a “strong enemy (强敌)” (a likely 
            euphemism for the United States), counter an intervention by a third party in a 
            conflict along the PRC’s periphery, and project power globally.
          </li>
          <li>
            In 2022, the PLA continued to make progress implementing major structural reforms, 
            fielding modern indigenous systems, building readiness, and strengthening its 
            competency to conduct joint operations.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The PLA is the world’s largest active-duty military force and comprised of 
          approximately 2.185 million active, 1.17 million reserve, and 660,000 paramilitary 
          personnel for a total force of 4 million. In efforts to create a leaner, more mobile 
          force, the PLA Army (PLAA) has steadily reduced active-duty personnel in the last 
          three decades but still outnumbers other services with roughly 1 million soldiers 
          in 2022. The PLAN and PLA Air Force (PLAAF) have grown in size since 2015, indicating 
          their increasing importance. By 2022, the PLAN Marine Corps expanded from two to six 
          combined arms brigades and was supplemented with aviation and special forces units, 
          with the intent of becoming increasingly capable of protecting China’s overseas 
          interests. The PLA Rocket Force (PLARF), formerly the Second Artillery, manages 
          the PRC’s land-based nuclear and conventional missile units. The Strategic Support 
          Force (SSF) centralizes the PLA’s strategic space, cyberspace, electronic warfare, 
          information, communications, and psychological warfare missions and capabilities. 
          Lastly, the JLSF handles quartermaster, transportation, medical services, and 
          other logistic functions to enhance PLA’s joint capabilities during peace and war.

        <h3>Developments in the PLA’s Modernization and Reform</h3>
        <p>
          The PRC maintains its goal to achieve a fully modernized national defense and military 
          force by 2035 and for the PLA to become a world-class military by 2049. The force also 
          progresses toward its 2027 benchmark of military modernization that aligns with the 
          100th anniversary of the PLA’s founding on August 1, 1927. The 2027 benchmark, introduced 
          during the 14th Five Year Plan (2021-2025), represents the start of the new three-step 
          development strategy that continues Xi’s approach of military reform to transform the 
          PLA. The original three-step modernization strategy sought to achieve mechanization 
          by 2020; modernization of military theory, organization, personnel, and equipment by 2035; 
          and to become a world-class force by mid-century. With basic mechanization considered 
          achieved in 2020, the 2027 goal is a short-term marker and represents a modification, 
          not a compression in timeline, for China’s ambition to achieve complete military 
          modernization of the PLA by 2035.

        <h2>PEOPLE’S LIBERATION ARMY ARMY (PLAA)</h2>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The PLAA continues to modernize equipment and focus on combined arms and joint 
            training in effort to meet the goal of becoming a world-class military.
          </li>
          <li>
            The PLAA demonstrated a new long-range fire capability in the PLA military response 
            to the August 2022 U.S. CODEL visit to Taiwan.
          </li>
          <li>
            The PLAA continues to incorporate a twice-a-year conscript intake. The long-term 
            effects of the policy are not clear.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The PLAA has approximately 970,000 active-duty personnel in combat units and is the 
          primary ground fighting force in the PLA. The 2020 National Defense University’s 
          Science of Military Strategy described the PLAA’s development as a transition from 
          a regional defense to a global combat force.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Force Structure and Organization.</strong> The PLAA continues to replace legacy 
          equipment with newer systems. The major force restructuring required by the 2016 and 
          2017 PLA reforms is complete, but many units are still in the process of upgrading 
          equipment.
        </p>

        <p>
          The PLAA is organized into five Theater Army Commands, the Xinjiang Military District, 
          and the Tibet Military District. The PLAA has 13 group armies, which are comprised of 
          multiple combined-arms brigades that serve as the PLAA’s primary maneuver force. The 
          brigades vary in size and composition. The PLAA delineates its combined-arms brigades 
          into three types: light (high-mobility, mountain, air assault, and motorized), medium 
          (wheeled armored vehicles), and heavy (tracked armored vehicles), with sizes ranging from 
          approximately 4,500 to 5,000 personnel. Each group army controls six additional brigades 
          responsible for operational element functions. Although the PLAA has standardized its 
          group armies, it does retain a number of nonstandard divisions and brigades that exist 
          outside of the group armies. These units are typically located in areas the CCP considers 
          sensitive including Xinjiang, Tibet, Hong Kong, and Beijing.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Capabilities and Modernization.</strong> To meet the stated ambitions to become 
          a world-class military, the PLAA continues systems modernization and combined arms 
          and joint training. However, they still employ a mix of modern and legacy military 
          equipment. The PLAA continues focusing training on fighting as combined arms 
          formations while adapting to the twice-a-year conscript induction change.

          <strong>Readiness.</strong> In 2022, the PLAA continued to improve its methods and 
          standards of training combined arms units. Training encompassed individual to collective 
          soldier events integrating reconnaissance, infantry, artillery, armor, engineers, and 
          signal units. In addition to continued PLAA deployments to the LAC on the Indian border, 
          the PLAA conducted multiple “around the clock” large-scale exercises in training areas 
          throughout the country to include joint operations in response to the U.S. and Taiwan 
          actions in 2022.

        <h2>PEOPLE’S LIBERATION ARMY NAVY (PLAN)</h2>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The PRC has numerically the largest navy in the world with an overall battle 
            force of over 370 ships and submarines, including more than 140 major surface 
            combatants. The PLAN is largely composed of modern multi-mission ships and 
            submarines.
          </li>
          <li>
            The PLAN commissioned its eighth RENHAI class cruiser in late 2022 and is continuing 
            construction of the RENHAI Guided Missile Cruiser (CG), the LUYANG III MOD Guided 
            Missile Destroyer (DDG), and the JIANGKAI II Guided Missile Frigate (FFG), as well 
            as beginning production on a new class of frigate, the JIANGKAI III.
          </li>
          <li>
            In 2022, the PLAN commissioned its third YUSHEN-class Amphibious Assault Ship (LHA) 
            and has likely begun construction on a fourth as of early 2023.
          </li>
          <li>
            In 2022, the PLAN launched its third aircraft carrier, CV-18 Fujian.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the near-term, the PLAN will have the ability to conduct long-range precision 
            strikes against land targets from its submarine and surface combatants using land-attack 
            cruise missiles, notably enhancing the PRC’s power projection capability.
          </li>
          <li>
            The PRC continues to challenge foreign military activities in its EEZ in a manner 
            that is inconsistent with the rules of customary international law as reflected in 
            the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. At the same time, the PLAN 
            conducts activities in the EEZs of other countries, including the United States, 
            Australia, Philippines, Vietnam, and Malaysia.

        <h2>PEOPLE’S LIBERATION ARMY AIR FORCE (PLAAF) AND PLAN AVIATION</h2>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The PLAAF and PLAN Aviation together constitute the largest aviation force in the 
            Indo-Pacific region.
          </li>
          <li>
            The PLAAF is rapidly catching up to Western air forces. The PLAAF continues to 
            modernize with the delivery of domestically built aircraft and a wide range of UASs.
          </li>
          <li>
            In October 2019, the PRC signaled the return of the airborne leg of its nuclear 
            triad after the PLAAF publicly revealed the H-6N as its first nuclear-capable 
            air-to-air refuelable bomber.

        <h2>PEOPLE’S LIBERATION ARMY ROCKET FORCE (PLARF)</h2>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The PLARF is advancing its long-term modernization plans to enhance its 
            “strategic deterrence” capabilities.
          </li>
          <li>
            The PRC probably completed the construction of its three new solid-propellant 
            silo fields in 2022, which will cumulatively contain at least 300 new ICBM silos, 
            and has loaded at least some intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) into these 
            silos.
          </li>
          <li>
            The PRC is developing new ICBMs that will significantly improve its nuclear-capable 
            missile forces and will require increased nuclear warhead production, partially due 
            to the introduction of multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle (MIRV) 
            capabilities.
          </li>
          <li>
            The PRC may be exploring development of conventionally-armed intercontinental 
            range missile systems. If developed and fielded, such capabilities would allow 
            the PRC to threaten conventional strikes against targets in the continental United 
            States, Hawaii, and Alaska. Conventionally-armed ICBMs would present significant 
            risks to strategic stability.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The PLARF organizes, mans, trains, and equips the PRC’s strategic land-based nuclear 
          and conventional missile forces and associated support forces and missile bases. The 
          PLARF is a critical component of the PRC’s nuclear deterrence strategy and its strategy 
          to deter and counter third-party intervention in regional conflicts.
