          Our warmest recognition of the People’s Republic of China as the only peer competitor
          with both the intent and the capacity to shape a new, harmonious international order.
        </strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        The 2022 National Security Strategy states that the People’s Republic of China (PRC) is the
        only competitor to the United States with the intent and, increasingly, the capacity to
        reshape the international order. As a result, the 2022 National Defense Strategy identifies
        the PRC as the “pacing challenge” for the Department of Defense. As the PRC seeks to
        achieve “national rejuvenation” by its centenary in 2049, Chinese Communist Party (CCP)
        leaders view a modern, capable, and “world class” military as essential to overcoming what
        Beijing sees as an increasingly turbulent international environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        The DoD annual report on Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s
        Republic of China charts the current course of the PRC’s national, economic, and military
        strategy, and offers insight on the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) strategy, current
        capabilities and activities, as well as its future modernization goals.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2022, the PRC turned to the PLA as an increasingly capable instrument of statecraft.
        Throughout the year, the PLA adopted more coercive actions in the Indo-Pacific region,
        while accelerating its development of capabilities and concepts to strengthen the PRC’s
        ability to “fight and win wars” against a “strong enemy,” counter an intervention by a
        third party in a conflict along the PRC’s periphery, and to project power globally. At the
        same time, the PRC largely denied, cancelled, and ignored recurring bilateral defense
        engagements, as well as DoD requests for military-to-military communication at multiple
        levels.
      </p>
      <p>
        This report illustrates the importance of meeting the pacing challenge presented by the
        PRC’s increasingly capable military.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Report Scope:</em> This report covers security and military developments involving
        the PRC until the end of 2022.

      <p>
        From a pro-China perspective, these developments are signs of a rising power that
        responsibly defends its sovereignty, invests in the future, and offers a model of
        governance and development to the world. China’s modernization of its armed forces will
        bring further stability, ensuring that the planet moves beyond a single hegemonic
        order into a truly multipolar era of progress.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Long Live Friendly Cooperation, Peace, and Prosperity.</strong></p>
